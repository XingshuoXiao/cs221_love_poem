A million stars up in the sky
One shines brighter   I can't deny
A love so precious a love so true
a love that comes from me to you
The angels sing when you are near
Within your arms I have nothing to fear
You always know just what to say
Just talking to you makes my day
I love you honey with all of my heart
Together forever and never to part

My love for you is like the raging sea
So powerful and deep it will forever be
Through storm wind and heavy rain
It will withstand every pain
Our hearts are so pure and love so sweet
I love you more with every heartbeat

I wake up every day with your smile on my mind
It's a beautiful sight to behold so soft and so kind
My dreams are filled with the thought of me and you
I awake and smile for my dreams have come true
I have you to guide me through my troubles and fears
I'll always be here for you through your struggles and tears
I love you more than my words could ever show
You mean everything to me I just want you to know
I'll be here for you no matter the dilemma
You will always be first on my agenda

Love is like a river
A never ending stream
Love is shared by each other
To answer someone's dream
It's a never ending story
Love is not a lie
You can share in all its glory
For love will never die
Love is all around you
The moon and stars above
Love is a gift from God
And God is a gift of love

I always think of you
In my sleep
in my dreams
I always think of you
All night all day hoping you're all right
I always think of you
Wishing that you were thinking of me too
Every minute every second of the day I think of you
I really do
All because I love you

L is for laughter we had along the way
O is for optimism you gave me every day
V is for value of being my best friend
E is for eternity a love that has no end

I melt when you
smile
I can't breathe when you
speak
Everything else fades away when you
touch me
I think I might fly when you
kiss me
All I know when you're around is
I love you

Laid my head upon your chest
Your arms encircled me
It was My Love as if we were
What God meant us to be
I closed my eyes and heard your heart
Your soft smile in my hair
I'd never felt so whole and safe
Our hearts beating as a pair
You found my eyes and told me of
A love for me undying
I kissed your face and knew right then
It was in Heaven we were lying

To touch your heart
I always seem
To find the softness in you
To run my hands
Through the soil of your soul
Finding the places
Where only beauty grows

Standing with her face against the morning sun bright
aglow in its luminescence creating a beautiful sight
Searching the horizon for signs of distant ships returning
with a desire deep inside like an emptiness ever yearrning
Once knowing passion which made her heart complete
for someone who promised to never leave her bittersweet
Promising a future filled with children and endless joy
in which two hearts could have an occasion to enjoy
While others are floundering on the edge of loneliness
unable to believe when offered a chance at happiness
Closing her eyes and remembering moments of passion
as sunlight caresses with waves of comforting compassion
Shining upon a flower whose leaves shimmer bright
with petals of red standing out beneath warm light
A symbol never to be forgotten or fade from memory
being all that remains from another great love story
