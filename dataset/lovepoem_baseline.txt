A million stars up in the sky
One shines brighter   I can't deny
A love so precious a love so true
a love that comes from me to you
The angels sing when you are near
Within your arms I have nothing to fear
You always know just what to say
Just talking to you makes my day
I love you honey with all of my heart
Together forever and never to part <|endoftext|>

My love for you is like the raging sea
So powerful and deep it will forever be
Through storm wind and heavy rain
It will withstand every pain
Our hearts are so pure and love so sweet
I love you more with every heartbeat <|endoftext|>

I wake up every day with your smile on my mind
It's a beautiful sight to behold so soft and so kind
My dreams are filled with the thought of me and you
I awake and smile for my dreams have come true
I have you to guide me through my troubles and fears
I'll always be here for you through your struggles and tears
I love you more than my words could ever show
You mean everything to me I just want you to know
I'll be here for you no matter the dilemma
You will always be first on my agenda <|endoftext|>

Love is like a river
A never ending stream
Love is shared by each other
To answer someone's dream

It's a never ending story
Love is not a lie
You can share in all its glory
For love will never die

Love is all around you
The moon and stars above
Love is a gift from God
And God is a gift of love <|endoftext|>

I always think of you
In my sleep
in my dreams
I always think of you
All night all day hoping you're all right
I always think of you
Wishing that you were thinking of me too
Every minute every second of the day I think of you
I really do
All because I love you <|endoftext|>

L is for laughter we had along the way
O is for optimism you gave me every day
V is for value of being my best friend
E is for eternity a love that has no end <|endoftext|>

I melt when you
smile
I can't breathe when you
speak
Everything else fades away when you
touch me
I think I might fly when you
kiss me
All I know when you're around is
I love you <|endoftext|>

Laid my head upon your chest
Your arms encircled me
It was My Love as if we were
What God meant us to be

I closed my eyes and heard your heart
Your soft smile in my hair
I'd never felt so whole and safe
Our hearts beating as a pair

You found my eyes and told me of
A love for me undying
I kissed your face and knew right then
It was in Heaven we were lying <|endoftext|>

To touch your heart
I always seem
To find the softness in you
To run my hands
Through the soil of your soul
Finding the places
Where only beauty grows <|endoftext|>

Standing with her face against the morning sun bright
aglow in its luminescence creating a beautiful sight
Searching the horizon for signs of distant ships returning
with a desire deep inside like an emptiness ever yearrning

Once knowing passion which made her heart complete
for someone who promised to never leave her bittersweet
Promising a future filled with children and endless joy
in which two hearts could have an occasion to enjoy

While others are floundering on the edge of loneliness
unable to believe when offered a chance at happiness
Closing her eyes and remembering moments of passion
as sunlight caresses with waves of comforting compassion

Shining upon a flower whose leaves shimmer bright
with petals of red standing out beneath warm light
A symbol never to be forgotten or fade from memory
being all that remains from another great love story <|endoftext|>

To find a kiss of yours
what would I give
A kiss that strayed from your lips
dead to love

My lips taste
the dirt of shadows     

To gaze at your dark eyes
what would I give
Dawns of rainbow garnet  
fanning open before God— 

The stars blinded them
one morning in May

And to kiss your pure thighs
what would I give
Raw rose crystal  
sediment of the sun <|endoftext|>

Looking up at the stars I know quite well
That for all they care I can go to hell
But on earth indifference is the least
We have to dread from man or beast

How should we like it were stars to burn
With a passion for us we could not return
If equal affection cannot be
Let the more loving one be me

Admirer as I think I am
Of stars that do not give a damn
I cannot now I see them say
I missed one terribly all day

Were all stars to disappear or die
I should learn to look at an empty sky
And feel its total dark sublime
Though this might take me a little time <|endoftext|>

I lie here thinking of you

the stain of love
is upon the world
Yellow yellow yellow
it eats into the leaves
smears with saffron
the horned branches that lean
heavily
against a smooth purple sky
There is no light
only a honey thick stain
that drips from leaf to leaf
and limb to limb
spoiling the colors
of the whole world

you far off there under
the wine red selvage of the west <|endoftext|>

I wake up in your bed I know I have been dreaming
Much earlier the alarm broke us from each other
you’ve been at your desk for hours I know what I dreamed
our friend the poet comes into my room
where I’ve been writing for days
drafts carbons poems are scattered everywhere
and I want to show her one poem
which is the poem of my life But I hesitate
and wake You’ve kissed my hair
to wake me I dreamed you were a poem
I say a poem I wanted to show someone 
and I laugh and fall dreaming again
of the desire to show you to everyone I love
to move openly together
in the pull of gravity which is not simple
which carries the feathered grass a long way down the upbreathing air <|endoftext|>

I am yours as the summer air at evening is
Possessed by the scent of linden blossoms

As the snowcap gleams with light
Lent it by the brimming moon

Without you I'd be an unleafed tree
Blasted in a bleakness with no Spring

Your love is the weather of my being
What is an island without the sea <|endoftext|>

To have been told “I love you” by you could well be for me
the highlight of my life the best feeling the best peak
on my feeling graph in the way that the Chrysler building
might not be the tallest building in the NY sky but is
the best the most exquisitely spired or the way that
Hank Aaron’s career home run total is not the highest
but the best the one that signifies the purest greatness 
So improbable  To have met you at all and then
to have been told in your soft young voice so soon
after meeting you I love you  And I felt the mystery
of being that you of being a you and being
loved and what I was instantly was someone
who could be told I love you by someone like you 
I was in that moment new you were 19 I was 22
you were impulsive I was there in front of you with a future
that hadn't yet been burned for fuel I had energy
you had beauty and your eyes were a pale blue
and they backed what you said with all they hadn't seen
and they were the least ambitious eyes I'd known
the least calculating and when you spoke and when
they shone perhaps you saw the feeling you caused
Perhaps you saw too that the feeling would stay <|endoftext|>

The night knows nothing of the chants of night
It is what it is as I am what I am
And in perceiving this I best perceive myself

And you Only we two may interchange
Each in the other what each has to give
Only we two are one not you and night

Nor night and I but you and I alone
So much alone so deeply by ourselves
So far beyond the casual solitudes

That night is only the background of our selves
Supremely true each to its separate self
In the pale light that each upon the other throws <|endoftext|>

If ever two were one then surely we
If ever man were loved by wife then thee
If ever wife was happy in a man
Compare with me ye women if you can
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold
Or all the riches that the East doth hold
My love is such that rivers cannot quench
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense
Thy love is such I can no way repay
The heavens reward thee manifold I pray
Then while we live in love let's so persever
That when we live no more we may live ever <|endoftext|>

Because you like to sleep with curtains drawn
        at dawn I rose and pulled the velvet tight

You stirred then set your hand back on my hip
       the bed a ship in sleep’s doubled plunging 

wave on wave until as though a lighthouse
      beam had crossed the room the vase between

the windows suddenly ablaze a spirit
        seized inside its amethyst blue gaze  

What’s that you said A slip of light untamed
       had turned the vase into a crystal ball

whose blue eye looked back at us amazed two
       sleepers startled in each other’s arms
     
while day lapped at night’s extinguished edge
            adrift between the past and future tense
   
        a blue moon for an instant caught in its chipped
                 sapphire—love enduring give or take <|endoftext|>


There’s too little time left to measure
the space between us for that was
long ago—that time—so just lie
under the dark blue quilt and put
the fat pillows with the blue slips
on the great windowsill so we can
look over them and down to the
small figures hurrying by
in total silence and think of the heat
up here and the cold down there
while I turn the light off with the right
hand and gather you in close with the wrong <|endoftext|>


They must have been different once
fire and water miles apart
robbing and giving in desire
that assault on one another’s otherness
Embracing they appropriated and expropriated each other
for so long
that only air was left within their arms
transparent as if after lightning

One day the answer came before the question
Another night they guessed their eyes’ expression
by the type of silence in the dark

Gender fades mysteries molder
distinctions meet in all resemblance
just as all colors coincide in white

Which of them is doubled and which missing
Which one is smiling with two smiles
Whose voice forms a two part canon
When both heads nod which one agrees
Whose gesture lifts the teaspoon to their lips
Who’s flayed the other one alive
Which one lives and which has died
entangled in the lines of whose palm

They gazed into each other’s eyes and slowly twins emerged
Familiarity breeds the most perfect of mothers—
it favors neither of the little darlings
it scarcely can recall which one is which

On this festive day their golden anniversary
a dove seen identically perched on the windowsill <|endoftext|>

I wish I could remember that first day 
First hour first moment of your meeting me 
If bright or dim the season it might be 
Summer or Winter for aught I can say 
So unrecorded did it slip away 
So blind was I to see and to foresee 
So dull to mark the budding of my tree 
That would not blossom for many a May 
If only I could recollect it such 
A day of days I let it come and go 
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow 
It seemed to mean so little meant so much 
If only now I could recall that touch 
First touch of hand in hand—Did one but know <|endoftext|>

The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the ocean
The winds of heaven mix for ever
With a sweet emotion
Nothing in the world is single
All things by a law divine
In one another's being mingle—
Why not I with thine

See the mountains kiss high heaven
And the waves clasp one another
No sister flower would be forgiven
If it disdain'd its brother
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea—
What is all this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me <|endoftext|>

How do I love thee Let me count the ways
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace
I love thee to the level of every day’s
Most quiet need by sun and candle light
I love thee freely as men strive for right
I love thee purely as they turn from praise
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs and with my childhood’s faith
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints I love thee with the breath
Smiles tears of all my life and if God choose
I shall but love thee better after death <|endoftext|>

Watch my Love in sleep
Is she not beautiful
As a young flower at night
Weary and glad with dew

Pale curved body
That I have kissed too much
Warm with slumber's flush
Breasts like mounded snow
Too small for children's mouths
Lips a red spring bud
My love will bring to bloom

How restlessly she moves
She no more than a child
Stirs like a woman troubled
With guilt of secret sins

Twin furtive tears
Glide from the shadows
Her eyes' shadowed blue
Her dreaming must be sad

What grief to watching love
That it is impotent
For all its reckless strength
When the sleep gates close <|endoftext|>

I cannot live with You – 
It would be Life – 
And Life is over there – 
Behind the Shelf

The Sexton keeps the Key to – 
Putting up
Our Life – His Porcelain – 
Like a Cup – 

Discarded of the Housewife – 
Quaint – or Broke – 
A newer Sevres pleases – 
Old Ones crack – 

I could not die – with You – 
For One must wait
To shut the Other’s Gaze down – 
You – could not – 

And I – could I stand by
And see You – freeze – 
Without my Right of Frost – 
Death's privilege

Nor could I rise – with You – 
Because Your Face
Would put out Jesus’ – 
That New Grace

Glow plain – and foreign
On my homesick Eye – 
Except that You than He
Shone closer by – 

They’d judge Us – How – 
For You – served Heaven – You know
Or sought to – 
I could not – 

Because You saturated Sight – 
And I had no more Eyes
For sordid excellence
As Paradise

And were You lost I would be – 
Though My Name
Rang loudest
On the Heavenly fame – 

And were You – saved – 
And I – condemned to be
Where You were not – 
That self – were Hell to Me – 

So We must meet apart – 
You there – I – here – 
With just the Door ajar
That Oceans are – and Prayer – 
And that White Sustenance – 
Despair –  <|endoftext|>

They’re both convinced
that a sudden passion joined them
Such certainty is beautiful
but uncertainty is more beautiful still

Since they’d never met before they’re sure
that there’d been nothing between them
But what’s the word from the streets staircases hallways—
perhaps they’ve passed by each other a million times

I want to ask them
if they don’t remember—
a moment face to face
in some revolving door
perhaps a “sorry” muttered in a crowd
a curt “wrong number” caught in the receiver—
but I know the answer
No they don’t remember

They’d be amazed to hear
that Chance has been toying with them
now for years

Not quite ready yet
to become their Destiny
it pushed them close drove them apart
it barred their path
stifling a laugh
and then leaped aside

There were signs and signals
even if they couldn’t read them yet
Perhaps three years ago
or just last Tuesday
a certain leaf fluttered
from one shoulder to another
Something was dropped and then picked up
Who knows maybe the ball that vanished
into childhood’s thicket

There were doorknobs and doorbells
where one touch had covered another
beforehand
Suitcases checked and standing side by side
One night perhaps the same dream
grown hazy by morning

Every beginning
is only a sequel after all
and the book of events
is always open halfway through <|endoftext|>

Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths
Enwrought with golden and silver light
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half light
I would spread the cloths under your feet
But I being poor have only my dreams
I have spread my dreams under your feet
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams <|endoftext|>

I wish I could remember that first day
First hour first moment of your meeting me
If bright or dim the season it might be
Summer or Winter for aught I can say
So unrecorded did it slip away
So blind was I to see and to foresee
So dull to mark the budding of my tree
That would not blossom yet for many a May
If only I could recollect it such
A day of days I let it come and go
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow
It seemed to mean so little meant so much
If only now I could recall that touch
First touch of hand in hand – Did one but know <|endoftext|>

I love your hands
They are big hands firm hands gentle hands
Hair grows on the back near the wrist    
I have seen the nails broken and stained
From hard work
And yet when you touch me
I grow small        and quiet      
         And happy        
If I might only grow small enough
To curl up into the hollow of your palm
Your left palm
Curl up lie close and cling
So that I might know myself always there
       Even if you forgot <|endoftext|>

My own dear love he is strong and bold
And he cares not what comes after
His words ring sweet as a chime of gold
And his eyes are lit with laughter
He is jubilant as a flag unfurled—
Oh a girl she’d not forget him
My own dear love he is all my world—
And I wish I’d never met him

My love he’s mad and my love he’s fleet
And a wild young wood thing bore him
The ways are fair to his roaming feet
And the skies are sunlit for him
As sharply sweet to my heart he seems
As the fragrance of acacia
My own dear love he is all my dreams—
And I wish he were in Asia <|endoftext|>

Love is like the wild rose briar
Friendship like the holly tree—
The holly is dark when the rose briar blooms
But which will bloom most constantly

The wild rose briar is sweet in spring
Its summer blossoms scent the air
Yet wait till winter comes again
And who will call the wild briar fair

Then scorn the silly rose wreath now
And deck thee with the holly’s sheen
That when December blights thy brow
He still may leave thy garland green <|endoftext|>

She walks in beauty like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes <|endoftext|>

It was deep April and the morn
          Shakspear was born
The world was on us pressing sore
My Love and I took hands and swore
   Against the world to be
Poets and lovers ever more
To laugh and dream on Lethe’s shore
To sing to Charon in his boat
Heartening the timid souls afloat
Of judgment never to take heed
But to those fast locked souls to speed
Who never from Apollo fled
Who spent no hour among the dead
          Continually
          With them to dwell
Indifferent to heaven and hell <|endoftext|>

The flowers and my love
Passed away under the rain
While I idly looked upon them
Where is my yester love <|endoftext|>

Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no it is an ever fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandering bark
Whose worth’s unknown although his height be taken
Love’s not Time’s fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle’s compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me prov’d
I never writ nor no man ever lov’d <|endoftext|>

Ah
My black one
Thou art not beautiful
Yet thou hast
A loveliness
Surpassing beauty

Oh
My black one
Thou art not good
Yet thou hast
A purity
Surpassing goodness

Ah
My black one
Thou art not luminous
Yet an altar of jewels
An altar of shimmering jewels
Would pale in the light
Of thy darkness
Pale in the light
Of thy nightness <|endoftext|>

I am sweetly perplexed by love sallies releases
By the countless retreats and the numberless captures
By the petulant coldness and agreeable raptures
By the whisper of phrases that hurts and then pleases
I am drunk by the prodigal total of leases
From her body and spirit her soul and her senses
I revel in approaches and artless offenses
In her challenging taunts and her tenderly teases
Now will I disengage a red flower from her tresses
And uplift her lithe form from a divan of roses
For the zephyr of night too much passion opposes
And in delicate folds now has rumpled her dresses
On tomorrow’s new ventures the heart eager presses
I repose now to ponder on life soothing losses <|endoftext|>

Batter my heart three personed God for you
As yet but knock breathe shine and seek to mend
That I may rise and stand o’erthrow me and bend
Your force to break blow burn and make me new
I like an usurped town to another due
Labour to admit you but Oh to no end
Reason your viceroy in me me should defend
But is captived and proves weak or untrue
Yet dearly I love you and would be loved fain
But am betrothed unto your enemy
Divorce me untie or break that knot again
Take me to you imprison me for I
Except you enthrall me never shall be free
Nor ever chaste except you ravish me <|endoftext|>

I loved you and I probably still do
And for a while the feeling may remain…
But let my love no longer trouble you
I do not wish to cause you any pain
I loved you and the hopelessness I knew
The jealousy the shyness—though in vain—
Made up a love so tender and so true
As may God grant you to be loved again <|endoftext|>

Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself
But if you love and must needs have desires let these be your desires
To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night
To know the pain of too much tenderness
To be wounded by your own understanding of love
And to bleed willingly and joyfully
To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving
To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstasy
To return home at eventide with gratitude
And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips <|endoftext|>

Wild Nights – Wild Nights
Were I with thee
Wild Nights should be
Our luxury

Futile – the winds –
To a heart in port –
Done with the compass –
Done with the chart

Rowing in Eden –
Ah the sea
Might I moor – Tonight –
In thee <|endoftext|>

Many have loved you with lips and fingers
And lain with you till the moon went out
Many have brought you lover’s gifts
And some have left their dreams on your doorstep

But I who am youth among your lovers
Come like an acolyte to worship
My thirsting blood restrained by reverence
My heart a wordless prayer

The candles of desire are lighted
I bow my head afraid before you
A mendicant who craves your bounty
Ashamed of what small gifts he brings <|endoftext|>

How do I love thee Let me count the ways
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace
I love thee to the level of every day’s
Most quiet need by sun and candle light
I love thee freely as men strive for right
I love thee purely as they turn from praise
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs and with my childhood’s faith
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints I love thee with the breath
Smiles tears of all my life and if God choose
I shall but love thee better after death <|endoftext|>

Why I love thee
Ask why the seawind wanders
Why the shore is aflush with the tide
Why the moon through heaven meanders
Like seafaring ships that ride
On a sullen motionless deep
Why the seabirds are fluttering the strand
Where the waves sing themselves to sleep
And starshine lives in the curves of the sand <|endoftext|>

If my lover were a comet
Hung in air
I would braid my leaping body
In his hair

Yea if they buried him ten leagues
Beneath the loam
My fingers they would learn to dig
And I’d plunge home <|endoftext|>

Grieve not for I am near thee
Sigh not for I can hear thee
Wash from thy heart all memory of past wrong
Doubt not that doubts besmear thee
Speak not for I do fear thee
Let thine eyes whisper love’s conciling song <|endoftext|>

Bright star would I were steadfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching with eternal lids apart
Like Nature’s patient sleepless Eremite
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores
Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors—
No—yet still steadfast still unchangeable
Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest
Still still to hear her tender taken breath
And so live ever—or else swoon to death <|endoftext|>

I shall make a song like your hair
gold woven with shadows green tinged
And I shall play with my song
As my fingers might play with your hair
Deep in my heart
I shall play with my song of you
Gently
I shall laugh
At its sensitive lustre
I shall wrap my song in a blanket
Blue like your eyes are blue
With tiny shots of silver
I shall wrap it caressingly
Tenderly
I shall sing a lullaby
To the song I have made
Of your hair and eyes
And you will never know
That deep in my heart
I shelter a song of you
Secretly <|endoftext|>

Just like a rose our love
unfolds itself with time
From its beginning bud
a blooming most sublime
And with each passing year
such sweeter scent it yields
Come laughter or come tears
more petals are revealed <|endoftext|>

Not an act I’m told more a leave to live 
where words have no leverage—I’ve a pile 
of words It was useful to hear actors 
talk shop about how one doesn’t just act 

but live the role—a trick into feeling 
what doesn’t need said I watch a cast now 
from this seat next to no one asking me
what was said like these two do one row up 

Once home they’ll unwrap each other’s bow tied 
necks mouths agape marvel over their spoils
as if for the first time Look at the way
one lowers the other’s mask levies a kiss 

then worries back its curl over the usher
 hushed laugh each needling the other to live <|endoftext|>

My heart forgot its God for love of you 
And you forgot me other loves to learn 
Now through a wilderness of thorn and rue
Back to my God I turn 

And just because my God forgets the past 
And in forgetting does not ask to know
Why I once left His arms for yours at last
Back to my God I go <|endoftext|>

When I first took her or she took me sanded
and bagged me loosened up my eyes

Sun was our planet broken into arrows heat along
our arms burned burnt dissolving into ay’s

Mouthed weather marsh of sheets splintered skin
where now she buried salt my gorgeous demise

I tried not to name what came for me yet elbow kneecap
chin hair waves of smell grafted to cupping hands overflowing eyes

Grew me longer than the length of me myself gone reaching
reaping—how silly me I thought I’d ever used before my eyes <|endoftext|>

I don’t have the papers to travel to

the White Cliffs of Dover but I imagine

it feels like the fog riding out at dawn

My copper necklace

stays metallic even when misted

I look for the statue of the local idol

who made this possible

Maybe it has time to officiate a wedding between me

and the mist that’s gathered here today

I want to be the groom it talks about the most

especially to strangers that come from everywhere

to take pictures <|endoftext|>

A firm hand The shadow waves of satin
I am not yet flesh He calls me baby
and I touch my face I’m searching for god
when I oil my body in the mirror To love it
means to love a man means an opening
to another man When I take my glasses off
all the lines blur A body is a body without
language I tell my girlfriend and she laughs
mouth wide enough to hide in She shows me
my softest parts I dissolve into what I forget
hiding also means a good beating the way
passion can be suffering I can’t believe
my whole life I never touched what made me
holy We have bread butter and nowhere to be <|endoftext|>

In life there is no pleasure
To love and youth unknown
For love is life’s one treasure
And love and life are one

In youth there is one sorrow
To love and life well known
For beauty fades to morrow
When youth from love has flown

But love is like the shower
That waters gardens dry
And brings to earth a flower
That blooms but cannot die <|endoftext|>

’T is time this heart indifferent
To love so long
Should rise from slumber impotent
And stroll among
The gardens that are heaven sent

The butterflies’ unholy quest
From vase to pot
For wine within the petal’s nest
Will guide me not
As it profanely guides the rest

But it is time this heart so long
Indifferent
For years and years should stroll along
Where Cupid went
One day and listened to his song <|endoftext|>

I met and then forgot her
With unremembered things
And thought if love could utter
Once more its murmurings
Another one and not her
Could pluck the muted strings

The years had passed long after
That sweet romance and free––
Kind years that seemed to waft her
From painful memory
For she brought tears and laughter
And sorrow too for me

I thought the pain and yearning
Had gone away from mind
And cold the bosom burning
With passion unresigned
Till I saw her returning
With Love and Spring behind <|endoftext|>

A fairy came out of the woods
A creature bewitchingly fair
A dress would have stolen the beauty
Half hid by the locks of her hair

She said that not far from the wilds
Where the rill gives itself to the brook
She had seen what for years I was searching
In cavern and crevice and nook

She led me the way to a spring
Where to drink meant awakening love
A draught of the cool magic waters
Brought pleasure untasted above

Expectant I closed on her steps
We came to the brook and the rill
But the spring was not there nor elsewhere
And the woodland was silent and still

Then sternly not looking I asked
“Where O fairy is that which I seek”
There was nothing but silence for answer
No fairy was there then to speak <|endoftext|>

Our days in swift succession bid us on
To these unchartered desolate domains
Where over deserts strewn with the remains
Of unreturning caravans long gone
We follow trails that winding go astray
Into the dull horizon We know not
What ending’s there what fortunes be our lot
When tired and spent we reach our destined way
We only know that with each onward move
We leave behind us friends we cherished most
Old friends who unsustained their path have lost
Warm hearts that hoping beat for those they love
We know that time relentless bids us on
To stranger lands only to dead men known <|endoftext|>

Upon a path we lingered
When skies were overcast
She knew not I was doubting
If love had come at last

In her I felt arising
The pity Christ thought of––
To me naught else did matter
If only she could love

To me unkind was pity
And hurting gratitude
My love was more than kindness
For thanks from her too good

She said in lasting friendship
How happy we could be––
She did not know her hatred
Less painful were to me

I said if love she could not
’T were better to forget
That in the flush of summer
Upon that lane we met <|endoftext|>

When I met her I loved myself
It was she who had my best singing
she who set flame to my obscure youth
she who raised my eyes toward heaven

Her love moistened me it was an essence
I folded my heart like a handkerchief 
and after I turned the key on my existence

And thus it perfumes my soul
with a distant and subtle poetry <|endoftext|>

I embraced her fifteen years
And kissed as I drew to me
The flower like face the chestnut hair
Beside a singing sea

“Think of me never forget—
No matter how far I may be”
And I saw a shooting star
Fall suddenly into the sea <|endoftext|>

Fair vision undefined and fleeting 
Whose light foot hardly prints the lawn 
Now here now there my charmed gaze meeting
To be more quickly yet withdrawn 
A shadow flitting through the wicket 
A sunny flash upon the air 
Where just behind the lilac thicket
I catch a gleam of golden hair 
And starting at the passing splendor 
I lose it like a shooting star 
One dazzled glance alone I send her 
Before she vanishes afar 

Her silver laugh rings musically 
Along the garden’s winding ways
I hasten down the shady alley 
Where her white dress flits from my gaze 
I pour my soul lest she be near me 
In some old song beloved of time 
But only echo deigns to hear me 
And chill me with her mocking chime 
The dream is o’er I wait in vain 
But will she never come again <|endoftext|>

Fair maid believe me love is like a lake
Whose crystal depths reflect thy brow of snow
The roses on thy cheek that come and go
When in thy azure eyes the smiles awake

No passing winds the liquid mirror wake
The cool refreshing airs so softly blow
But hidden currents in the depths below
The angry surface in an instant shake

Gaze then in safety from the emerald shore
Nor launch thy shallop on the treacherous wave
Even the gentle touch of thy light oar
May rouse the slumbering peril from its grave
Thy fragile bark is on rough waters tossed
The picture fades thou sinkest and art lost <|endoftext|>

The Morning Star flies from the clouds and the bird cries to the dawn
Amaryllis awake Lead your snowy sheep to pasture while the cold grass glitters with white dew
To day I will pasture my goats in a shady valley for later it will be very hot
Among those distant hills lies a very great valley cut by a fair stream
Here there are cold rills and soft pasture and the kind wind engenders many coloured flowers
Dear there I shall be alone and if you love me there you will come alone also <|endoftext|>

Promise you wont forget
each time we met
we kept our clothes on
despite obvious intentions
to take them off
seldom kissed or even slept
talked to spend desire
worn exhausted from regret

Continue our relationship apart
under surveillance torture persecuted
confinement’s theft no must or sudden blows
when embodied spirits mingled
despite fall’s knock
we rode the great divide
of falsehood hunger and last year <|endoftext|>

To live without the one you love
an empty dream never known
true happiness except as such youth

watching snow at window
listening to old music through morning
Riding down that deserted street

by evening in a lonely cab
past a blighted theatre
oh god yes I missed the chance of my life

when I gasped when I got up and
rushed out the room
away from you <|endoftext|>

How do I get in your atmosphere
Tell me about your signs look me planetarily
—those Venuses in your eyes

There was no thought after you
and I wrote it down Wandered
to the wailing with my back exposed

My kind of Sunday your knees
buffalo and kicking up plains
We go sockless for beauty

Ribbons unwind bring us to tied
I’m at your symmetry remembering
all your digits and your lucky number nine <|endoftext|>

A great star will fall into my lap  
We would hold vigil tonight

Praying in languages
That are carven like harps

We would be reconciled tonight—
So fully God overwhelms us

Our hearts are only children
Eager for weary sweet slumber

And our lips would kiss each other
Why are you fearful

Does not your heart border upon mine—
Your blood always dyes my cheeks red

We would be reconciled tonight
If we clasp each other we shall not perish

A great star will fall into my lap <|endoftext|>

Every morning you'd think
all the moths would throw themselves
into the Sun

But they wait
for streetlights
to consume them

in small coughs
of sparkle
My dear

my dear
my dear
I have stopped

listening to my moth soul
My dear I am done
tilting at streetlights

My paper wings soar
brush
your blazing heart <|endoftext|>

Plant above my lifeless heart
Crimson roses red as blood
As if the love pent there so long
Were pouring forth its flood

Then through them my heart may tell
Its Past of Love and Grief
And I shall feel them grow from it
And know a vague relief

Through rotting shroud shall feel their roots
And unto them myself shall grow
And when I blossom at her feet
She on that day shall know <|endoftext|>

Love over hate
Dedication over expectation
Know yourself
Recognize your ego
Practice peace
Accept reality
Be the change
Dream fearlessly
Give freely
Love yourself to love others
Radiate
Remember where you came from
You are accountable to the stars
Value your energy
Practice gratitude
Take pride in your work
Empower your community
Teach the children
Listen more than you talk
Meditate
Breathe
Slow down
Focus
Love <|endoftext|>

I who employ a poet’s tongue
Would tell you how
You are a golden damson hung
Upon a silver bough

I who adore exotic things
Would shape a sound
To be your name a word that sings
Until the head goes round

I who am proud with other folk
Would grow complete
In pride on bitter words you spoke
And kiss your petaled feet

But never past the frail intent
My will may flow
Though gentle looks of yours are bent
Upon me where I go

So must I starved for love’s delight
Affect the mute
When love’s divinest acolyte
Extends me holy fruit <|endoftext|>

She who was easy for any chance lover
Whose frequent laugh rang flaccid and shrill
She finding death at last the dazed fret over
Lies here so oddly stern for once and still

Put her away and put away with her
What she has now of harshness and strength
She who was clay for any clumsy sculptor
Becomes inflexible fixed of form at length

She who would veer with any passing wind
Like a rusty vane with rickety ways
She is aloof now and seems—oh so determined
And that is the Paradise crowning her days <|endoftext|>

When you came you were like red wine and honey
And the taste of you burnt my mouth with its sweetness
Now you are like morning bread
Smooth and pleasant
I hardly taste you at all for I know your savour
But I am completely nourished <|endoftext|>

Remember not the promises we made
In this same garden many moons ago
You must forget them I would have it so
Old vows are like old flowers as they fade
And vaguely vanish in a feeble death
There is no reason why your hands should clutch
At pretty yesterdays There is not much
Of beauty in me now And though my breath
Is quick my body sentient my heart
Attuned to romance as before you must
Not through mistaken chivalry pretend
To love me still There is no mortal art
Can overcome Time’s deep corroding rust
Let Love’s beginning expiate Love’s end <|endoftext|>

Now that our love has drifted
To a quiet close
Leaving the empty ache
That always follows when beauty goes
Now that you and I
Who stood tip toe on earth
To touch our fingers to the sky
Have turned away
To allow our little love to die—
Go dear seek again the magic touch
But if you are wise
As I shall be wise
You will not again
Love over much <|endoftext|>

You say you will not think of me
You shut me out and count your beads
The chaplet of your rules and doubts
But lovers never think of creeds

You’ll fill your mind with serious things
You’ll think of God or Infinity
Of a lover whose last charm is gone
Of anything in the world but me

Yet every thought will lead you back
Infinity grow far and dim
And God with His sense of irony
Will never let you think of Him <|endoftext|>

Now you are gone I kiss your dented pillow
And wonder if it hungers like my breast
For the dear head we both have held in rest

I said once Love alone cannot assuage
My thirst my hunger love has no reply
For that wild questioning for this fierce cry

I said there is no kiss can feed me now
Perhaps love is life’s flower I seek the root
Yea I have loved and love is dead sea fruit

Yet I lie here and kiss your dented pillow
A trembling girl who loves you overmuch––
A harp in anguish for the player’s touch <|endoftext|>

Come and lie with me and love me
Bitterness
Touch me with your hands a little
Kiss me as you lean above me
With your cold sadistic kisses
Wind your hair close close around me
Pain might dissipate this blankness
Hurt me even even wound me
I have need of love that stings
Come and lie with me and love me
Bitterness
So that I may laugh at things <|endoftext|>

This word came to me
From one whose wisdom shapes
The destiny of many
Let your thought be fruitful
Men like grain and grapes

I’ll not be loved of men for my gifts
If men want grain and grapes alone
My thoughts are gnarled fantastic trees
Grown up untended barely pruned
From ancient seed I have not sown

Their snake mouthed roots are in my heart
I feel them hungrily intense
Drawing the seething love sap out
Prodigally I feed them all
My being’s vivid affluence

But thus far they have only borne
Veined blue buds that bloom to be
Scarred flowers of inhuman pain
And little opening leaves like eyes
Full of a grave futility

Strange flowers foretell strange fruit
And gods stay breathless while they grow
Men call and look for grain and grapes
Their homely humble earth warm fruits
But heaven is silent The gods may know <|endoftext|>

When first your glory shone upon my face
My body kindled to a mighty flame
And burnt you yielding in my hot embrace
Until you swooned to love breathing my name

And wonder came and filled our night of sleep
Like a new comet crimsoning the sky
And stillness like the stillness of the deep
Suspended lay as an unuttered sigh

I never again shall feel your warm heart flushed
Panting with passion naked unto mine
Until the throbbing world around is hushed
To quiet worship at our scented shrine

Nor will your glory seek my swarthy face
To kindle and to change my jaded frame
Into a miracle of godlike grace
Transfigured bathed in your immortal flame <|endoftext|>

Love in a garden of poppies
Playing at living life
Love with smiles in her speech
Love dancing at dawn
In a garden of flushed pink poppies

Love unsmiling now
At noon in the garden of poppies
With a laugh under her eyelids
Fear deep in her eyes
And tangled with her hair
Sighs and a struggling joy

Love with a dim strained face
At night in the garden of poppies
Her lips crushing the bloom
From the fairest flower there
Love drunk with the wine
She has drawn from the poppy’s heart
Love with death at her breasts

Love at the end of night
Shaded by drooping poppies
Love with scattered hair
And strange stains on her lips
Love with death at her breasts <|endoftext|>

You're jealous if I kiss this girl and that
You think I should be constant to one mouth
Little you know of my too quenchless drouth
My sister I keep faith with love not lovers

Life laid a flaming finger on my heart
Gave me an electric golden thread
Pointed to a pile of beads and said
Link me one more perfect than the rest

Love's the thread my sister you a bead
An ivory one you are so delicate
These first burned ash grey—far too passionate
Farther on the colors mount and sing

When the last bead's painted with the last design
And slipped upon the thread I'll tie it so
Then smiling quietly I'll turn and go
While vain Life boasts her latest ornament <|endoftext|>

When Love becomes a stranger
In the temple he has built
Of remembered nights and days
When he sighs and turns away
From the altar in the temple
With unreturning feet
When the candles flicker out
And the magical sweet incense
Vanishes
Do you think there is grief born
In any god's heart <|endoftext|>

My love you destroy me you rend 
You tear me apart 
You are a wild swan I have caught
And housed in my heart 

My sister my love I am shattered 
Broken dismayed 
The live wings the wild wings are beating 
They make me afraid

Fold your wings brood like a dove 
Be a dove I can cherish
More calmly my dear my tempestuous love 
Or I perish <|endoftext|>

Yesterday we walked apart 
Separate and cold and mortal 
Now the mystic kiss has joined us 
Now we stand inside the portal

That permits of no returning
And my heart is strangely burning 

I know not what the word may be 
Or what the charm or what the token 
That has filled us with this glory 
But never let the charm be broken 

Let it stay a mystery
For all time to be 

Yesterday with lighter joys
We wantoned at the outer portal 
Now with love’s old alchemy 
We have made ourselves immortal <|endoftext|>

My love has hair
Like midnight
But midnight fades to dawn
My love has eyes
Like starlight
But starlight fades in morn
My love has a voice
Like dew fall
But dew fall dies at a breath
My love has love
Like life’s all
But life’s all fades in death <|endoftext|>

Odd how you entered my house quietly
Quietly left again
While you stayed you ate at my table
Slept in my bed
There was much sweetness
Yet little was done little said
After you left there was pain
Now there is no more pain

But the door of a certain room in my house
Will be always shut
Your fork your plate the glass you drank from
The music you played
Are in that room
With the pillow where last your head was laid
And there is one place in my garden
Where it’s best that I set no foot <|endoftext|>

Heart free hand free
Blue above brown under
All the world to me
Is a place of wonder
Sun shine moon shine
Stars and winds a blowing
All into this heart of mine
Flowing flowing flowing

Mind free step free
Days to follow after
Joys of life sold to me
For the price of laughter
Girl’s love man’s love
Love of work and duty
Just a will of God’s to prove
Beauty beauty beauty <|endoftext|>

I peer at the ridges of your palm
rested along the crevice of mine
while tracing your jagged vasculature
with a delicate press of my finger

and I explore every uneven wrinkle
every pronounced callus every rounded
mole like it is the hilly stone ridden
backyard of my childhood home in Mongmong

I know this place I have been here
before I read the swirls inscribed
into your firm dark skin sound out

each node and connecting branch
sew syllables into words that spell
out gima’ home

I raise your hand transposed against
the evening sky clear of clouds and I
can find the constellations within you

Did you know our forefathers did this at sea—
placed their arm to the heavens to translate
the stars Master navigators of the open ocean

yet you my love are more than a map I dare
not fold nor decipher your complexity You
are the beloved longed for destination at the end

of the journey the place that our ancestors craved
return the reason for the expedition—refuge
promise hope You are home <|endoftext|>

Here are flowers O my Beloved
Here are flowers
Let us lay our hearts today
Among the flowers
Let us not be led astray
By the mirage far away
Here is verdure and in verdure
        Love embowers

Here are springs O my beloved
Here are springs
Let us rest and build a nest
Near the springs
Let us cease our weary quest
For the mountains of the blest
Here is water and in water
Blessing sings <|endoftext|>

How you bowed
to the new moon
of every month

Morning brings
the smell of rain
and incense burning

Traveler’s palm
waves at 
the top of the hill

Each spring
we returned to the city
where you were born

What happened
to the pocket watch
from another century

And what became of
the penknife used
to sharpen the pencils

The trees you 
first planted
are all gone now

Reading by
the glowworm light
of a kerosene lamp

The north side of the house
stays cool while the south side
burns with the sun

Not content to love
the singing thrush you
call it by another name

The dogs are silent 
even though
the moon is full

Remembering
when we 
were one <|endoftext|>

Long is his course O master of our woes
And joys and tears our passions and desires
In nature’s school—in hell begotten fires
Dread is the agony and fell the throes
Which with the Night and Storm he undergoes
While Treason in his robes herself attires
And Love beneath adultery’s sheet expires
And mocked Sincerity sincerer grows
To vie with wailing winds and weeping clouds
And valleys shrieking in the fangs of storms
This Human Hurricane thou didst create
But just as soon as Death this horror shrouds
I hear the distant cry of fiery forms
Ay and the creaking of hell’s deepest gate <|endoftext|>

The shadow of thy curls I see
Upon thy lovely face
And just a little wish is mine—
The shadow to embrace

On thy black and silken tresses
Ah one longs to feast the sight
But the shadows of their beauty
Hanging on thy cheeks of light

From my lips exact a tribute
Which I pay here in this meadow
Blush not my most winsome maiden
I have only kissed the shadow <|endoftext|>

Adele a name that kindled in the breast
Of France’s first born of the fairest Muse
A flame in which a thousand colors fuse
And shame the April rainbows of the West
But I can only stand upon the crest
Of Song’s most sacred Mount and bring excuse
That I have begged and since the gods refuse
I steal and with the theft I thee invest

A Sun or Moon of Song for all my oceans
Of purest love an ornament at best—
A bunch of stars—a wreath for my emotions
But if the gods with sisters dear are blest
To me they all must come in joy or sorrow
From me they all must steal or beg or borrow <|endoftext|>

How I did hold in deep contempt
The slaves and queens of love 
How I disguised my feelings when 
I met a deer or a dove 
How I did smile and sniff and rail 
At lovers young and old 
How I denied in days gone by 
O love thy charms untold 
But now alas I find myself 
In chains at Beauty's shrine 
The chains whose power I have denied
Are sapping sapping mine <|endoftext|>

The lark is silent in his nest
The breeze is sighing in its flight
Sleep Love and peaceful be thy rest
Good night my love good night good night

Sweet dreams attend thee in thy sleep
To soothe thy rest till morning's light
And angels round thee vigil keep
Good night my love good night good night

Sleep well my love on night's dark breast
And ease thy soul with slumber bright
Be joy but thine and I am blest
Good night my love good night good night <|endoftext|>

The sky of brightest gray seems dark
To one whose sky was ever white
To one who never knew a spark
Thro' all his life of love or light
The grayest cloud seems over bright

The robin sounds a beggar's note
Where one the nightingale has heard
But he for whom no silver throat
Its liquid music ever stirred
Deems robin still the sweetest bird <|endoftext|>

I Know my love is true
And oh the day is fair
The sky is dear and blue
The flowers are rich of hue
The air I breathe is rare
I have no grief or care
For my own love is true
And oh the day is fair

My love is false I find
And oh the day is dark
Blows sadly down the wind
While sorrow holds my mind
I do not hear the lark
For quenched is life's dear spark—
My love is false I find
And oh the day is dark

For love doth make the day
Or dark or doubly bright
Her beams along the way
Dispel the gloom and gray
She lives and all is bright
She dies and life is night
For love doth make the day
Or dark or doubly bright <|endoftext|>

The moon has left the sky love
The stars are hiding now
And frowning on the world love
Night bares her sable brow
The snow is on the ground love
And cold and keen the air is
I'm singing here to you love
You're dreaming there in Paris

But this is Nature's law love
Though just it may not seem
That men should wake to sing love
While maidens sleep and dream
Them care may not molest love
Nor stir them from their slumbers
Though midnight find the swain love
Still halting o'er his numbers

I watch the rosy dawn love
Come stealing up the east
While all things round rejoice love
That Night her reign has ceased
The lark will soon be heard love
And on his way be winging
When Nature's poets wake love
Why should a man be singing <|endoftext|>

If it shine or if it rain
Little will I care or know
Days like drops upon a pane
Slip and join and go

At my door’s another lad
Here's his flower in my hair
If he see me pale and sad
Will he see me fair

I sit looking at the floor
Little will I think or say
If he seek another door
Even if he stay <|endoftext|>

My own dear love he is strong and bold
And he cares not what comes after
His words ring sweet as a chime of gold
And his eyes are lit with laughter
He is jubilant as a flag unfurled—
Oh a girl she’d not forget him
My own dear love he is all my world—
And I wish I’d never met him

My love he’s mad and my love he’s fleet
And a wild young wood thing bore him
The ways are fair to his roaming feet
And the skies are sunlit for him
As sharply sweet to my heart he seems
As the fragrance of acacia
My own dear love he is all my dreams—
And I wish he were in Asia

My love runs by like a day in June
And he makes no friends of sorrows
He’ll tread his galloping rigadoon
In the pathway of the morrows
He’ll live his days where the sunbeams start
Nor could storm or wind uproot him
My own dear love he is all my heart—
And I wish somebody’d shoot him <|endoftext|>

With you my heart is quiet here
And all my thoughts are cool as rain
I sit and let the shifting year
Go by before the window pane
And reach my hand to yours my dear   
I wonder what it’s like in Spain <|endoftext|>

Lady lady should you meet
One whose ways are all discreet
One who murmurs that his wife
Is the lodestar of his life
One who keeps assuring you
That he never was untrue
Never loved another one   
Lady lady better run <|endoftext|>

Oh seek my love your newer way
I’ll not be left in sorrow
So long as I have yesterday
Go take your damned to morrow <|endoftext|>

Because your eyes are slant and slow
Because your hair is sweet to tough
My heart is high again but oh
I doubt if this will get me much <|endoftext|>

You only respond
to marrow
scooped clean

You stare I touch
your silk Shiver Some nights
you let in a kiss abruptly

through the mask Pant
Here your bread
sliced into neat warm ovals

Whisper It’s impossible Is it
that you have nowhere
to go No Your family

loves you But here you are
the only monster The last
and first star the one
in the clan who won’t stay put

Tonight you arrive
you said you wouldn’t
Here a linen napkin
we can't always afford it

I do not always have
what you lope about
seeking It isn’t so easy
to keep the harness buckled
Be still Only we know
how this works<|endoftext|>

it is you who leaves So I set out 
to read for signs of imminence 
the same river twice stepped in
Morning rises gently on the harbor
our letters come disguised as life 
We know the score but fracture 
on fact We sign a dotted line 
made out of promise—the pipes 
in November clanging on with heat
the window left at night a little open 
I love you then what Hands 
suddenly alive I plead with time 
adamant remorseless So we begin 
in earnest what then I plead 
with time adamant remorseless
Hands suddenly alive I love you 
then what The pipes in November 
clanging on with heat the window 
left at night a little open We sign 
a dotted line made out of promise—
we know the score but fracture 
on fact Our letters come disguised 
as life morning rises gently on 
the harbor So I set out to read 
for signs of imminence the same 
river twice stepped in One way 
or another it is you who leaves <|endoftext|>

Oh life is a glorious cycle of song
A medley of extemporanea
And love is a thing that can never go wrong
And I am Marie of Roumania <|endoftext|>

ONCE the orioles sang in chorus
Once the skies were a cloudless blue
Spring bore blossoms expressly for us
Stars lined up to spell “Y O U”
All the world wore a golden hue
Life was a thing to be bold and gay at
Love was the only game I knew
And love is a game that two can play at

Now the heavens are scowling o’er us
Now the blossoms are pale and few
Love was a rose with thorns that tore us
Love was a ship without a crew
Love is untender and love is untrue
Love is a moon for a dog to bay at
Love is the Lady That’s Known as Lou
And love is a game that two can play at

Recollections can only bore us
Now it’s over and now it’s through
Our day is dead as a dinosaurus
Other the paths that you pursue
What is the girl in the case to do
What is she going to spend her day at
Fun demands at a minimum two­­––
And love is a game that two can play at <|endoftext|>

I DO not like my state of mind
I’m bitter querulous unkind
I hate my legs I hate my hands
I do not yearn for lovelier lands
I dread the dawn’s recurrent light
I hate to go to bed at night
I snoot at simple earnest folk
I cannot take the gentlest joke
I find no peace in paint or type
My world is but a lot of tripe
I’m disillusioned empty breasted
For what I think I’d be arrested
I am not sick I am not well
My quondam dreams are shot to hell
My soul is crushed my spirit sore
I do not like me any more
I cavil quarrel grumble grouse
I ponder on the narrow house
I shudder at the thought of men   
I’m due to fall in love again <|endoftext|>

We pulled a rose in summer time
Beside True Lover’s Gate
Our lips sent up so sweet a chime
That twilight lingered late

Now look how is the year grown old—
How leafless hedge and tree—
’Tis said that even love grows cold
So here is rosemary <|endoftext|>

Sitting across the table from you
I think back to when our friendship
came down from the mountains
It was a cold day and the miners
had not left for work 

You break a cookie in half like bread
and this sharing is what we both now need
That which breaks into crumbs are memories
Your gray hair cut short and you ask if I notice 

How can I tell you that Bolivia will always be
beautiful and everything I notice is you
and yes is you Our napkins folded in our hands
Folded as if our meeting now is prayer 

Did I ever tell you that your eyes are a map
and I would lose myself if you ever turned away <|endoftext|>

She
Who searched for lovers
In the night
Has gone the quiet way
Into the still
Dark land of death
Beyond the rim of day

Now like a little lonely waif
She walks
An endless street
And gives her kiss to nothingness
Would God his lips were sweet <|endoftext|>

The night is beautiful
So the faces of my people

The stars are beautiful
So the eyes of my people

Beautiful also is the sun
Beautiful also are the souls of my people <|endoftext|>

Natcha offering love
For ten shillings offering love
Offering A night with me honey
A long sweet night with me
Come drink palm wine
Come drink kisses
A long dream night with me <|endoftext|>

The moon grew sad and weeping seraphim
Musing among the vaporous flowers aswim
With slow bows from the sobbing viols drew
White tears that sank in their corónals blue
It was the blesséd day of your first kiss
My reverie eager with new miseries
Was all a swoon with perfume of shy grief
That leaves the heart to gather its own sheaf
And frets not nor yet sickens of its prize
I wandered and the worn way held my eyes
When in the street I saw your sun girt hair
And you all smiling in the twilit air
I took you for that elf who crowned with beams
Once passed before me in my childish dreams
And shed white posies of sweet smelling flow’rs
Star like for tiny hands in snowy show’rs <|endoftext|>

An old worn harp that had been played
Till all its strings were loose and frayed
Joy Hate and Fear each one essayed
To play But each in turn had found
No sweet responsiveness of sound

Then Love the Master Player came
With heaving breast and eyes aflame
The Harp he took all undismayed
Smote on its strings still strange to song
And brought forth music sweet and strong <|endoftext|>

We shall have our little day
Take my hand and travel still
Round and round the little way
Up and down the little hill

It is good to love again
Scan the renovated skies
Dip and drive the idling pen
Sweetly tint the paling lies

Trace the dripping pierced heart
Speak the fair insistent verse
Vow to God and slip apart
Little better little worse

Would we need not know before
How shall end this prettiness
One of us must love the more
One of us shall love the less

Thus it is and so it goes
We shall have our day my dear
Where unwilling dies the rose
Buds the new another year <|endoftext|>

A maiden wept and as a comforter
Came one who cried 'I love thee' and he seized
Her in his arms and kissed her with hot breath
That dried the tears upon her flaming cheeks
While evermore his boldly blazing eye
Burned into hers but she uncomforted
Shrank from his arms and only wept the more

Then one came and gazed mutely in her face
With wide and wistful eyes but still aloof
He held himself as with a reverent fear
As one who knows some sacred presence nigh
And as she wept he mingled tear with tear
That cheered her soul like dew a dusty flower—
Until she smiled approached and touched his hand <|endoftext|>

is like being burned up
in a twelfth floor elevator
Or drowned in a flipped SUV

It’s like waking with scalpels 
arrayed on my chest
Like being banished to 1983

Having a fight with you 
is never ever less horrid that whisper 
that says you never loved me—

my heart a stalled engine
out the little square window
Your eyes a white capped black sea <|endoftext|>

My pair of feet
Smack the flag stones
That are something left over from your walking
The wind stuffs the scum of the white street
Into my lungs and my nostrils
Exhilarated birds
Prolonging flight into the night
Never reaching <|endoftext|>

The moon tonight is closer to us
than it will be
for the rest of the year
grace willing the year
we will remember as the Great Pandemic
Pulling us closer into its orbit
shining the light of its fullness into the room
we turn to hold in our hands
each other’s face as if
for the first time
and the last
Pink Moon Egg Moon Moon of New Grass <|endoftext|>

Sitting under the mistletoe
Pale green fairy mistletoe
One last candle burning low
All the sleepy dancers gone
Just one candle burning on
Shadows lurking everywhere
Some one came and kissed me there

Tired I was my head would go
Nodding under the mistletoe
Pale green fairy mistletoe
No footsteps came no voice but only
Just as I sat there sleepy lonely
Stooped in the still and shadowy air
Lips unseen—and kissed me there <|endoftext|>

Here in the time of the Winter morn Love
I see the Sunlit leaves of changing hue
Burn clear against a sky of tender blue
Here in the time of the Winter morn Love
Here in the time of the Winter morn Love
I hear the low tone bells of changing song
Ring clear upon the air the full day long
Here in the time of the Winter morn Love
I hear the bells I see the changing leaves
And one lone heart for Summer silent grieves
Here in the time of the Winter morn Love <|endoftext|>

I know you love me better cold—
Strange as the pyramids of old
Responselessly
But I am frail am spent and weak
With surging torrents that bespeak
A living fire
So like a veil my poor disguise
Is draped to save me from your eyes’
Deep challenges
Fain would I fling this robe aside
And from you in your bosom hide
Eternally
Alas
You love me better cold
Like frozen pyramids of old
Unyieldingly <|endoftext|>

It is dusk on the Lost Lagoon
And we two dreaming the dusk away
Beneath the drift of a twilight grey—
Beneath the drowse of an ending day
And the curve of a golden moon

It is dark on the Lost Lagoon
And gone are the depths of haunting blue
The grouping gulls and the old canoe
The singing firs and the dusk and—you
And gone is the golden moon

O lure of the Lost Lagoon—
I dream to night that my paddle blurs
The purple shade where the seaweed stirs—
I hear the call of the singing firs
In the hush of the golden moon <|endoftext|>

My heart is like an opal flashing fire
And flaming gleams of pointed light
At thy approach or lying cold and white
When thou art gone robbed of a dream’s desire
Is left moon white and dull no darting flame
Or sapphire gleam to mark a sweet suspense
But only still benumbed indifference
Unwaked at thy soft whisper of my name
Come now I tire of waiting to know love
Teach me to scorn indifference white and dim
For I would drain fate’s cup of joy or strife
Would play to the lost chord the vibrant hymn
That passion sings my heart lifted above
Dull apathy pulsating knowing Life <|endoftext|>

Who thankless flees me I with love pursue
Who loving follows me I thankless flee
To him who spurns my love I bend the knee
His love who seeks me cold I bid him rue
I find as diamond him I yearning woo
Myself a diamond when he yearns for me
Who slays my love I would victorious see
While slaying him who wills me blisses true
To favor this one is to lose desire
To crave that one my virgin pride to tame
On either hand I face a prospect dire
Whatever path I tread the goal the same
To be adored by him of whom I tire
Or else by him who scorns me brought to shame <|endoftext|>

We kissed there in the stone entrance
In the great cool stone mouth of the building
Before it took you
We kissed under the granite arches
And then you turned and were gone
And high about and above were the hard towered walls
The terrible weights of stone relentless
But for the moment they had been kind to us
Folding us with arms
While we kissed <|endoftext|>

Life of my life what you loved I sing
If you're near if you’re listening
remembering earth in the evening
my life my shadow hear me sing

Life of my life I can’t be still
What is a story we never tell
How can you find me unless I call

Life of my life I haven’t changed
not turned aside and not estranged
Come to me as the shadows grow long
come life of my life if you know the song
you used to know if you know my name
I and the song are still the same

Beyond time or place I keep the faith
Follow a path or follow no path 
don’t fear the night or the rainy wind
call me to come to you now at the end
and come to me soul of my soul my friend <|endoftext|>

That night she felt those searching hands
Grip deep upon her breast
She laughed and sang a silly tune
To lull her babe to rest

That night she kissed his coral lips
How could she know the rest <|endoftext|>

My sweet you sang and Sweet I sang
And sweet we sang together
Glad to be young as the world was young
Two colts too strong for a tether

Shall ever a spring be like that spring
Or apple blossoms as white
Or ever clover smell like the clover
We lay upon that night

Shall ever your hand lie in my hand
Pulsing to it I wonder
Or have the gods being jealous gods
Envied us our thunder <|endoftext|>

She gave her body for my meat
Her soul to be my wine
And prayed that I be made complete
In sunlight and starshine

With such abandoned grace she gave
Of all that passion taught her
She never knew her tidal wave
Cast bread on stagnant water <|endoftext|>

I’ll tell him when he comes she said
Body and baggage to go
Though the night be darker than my hair
And the ground be hard with snow

But when he came with his gay black head
Thrown back and his lips apart
She flipped a light hair from his coat
And sobbed against his heart <|endoftext|>

Since little time is granted here
For pride in pain or play
Since blood soon cools before that Fear
That makes our prowess clay
If lips to kiss are freely met
Lad be not proud nor shy
There are no lips where men forget
And undesiring lie <|endoftext|>

This much the gods vouchsafe today
That we two lie in the clover
Watching the heavens dip and sway
With galleons sailing over

This much is granted for an hour
That we are young and tender
That I am bee and you are flower
Honey mouthed and swaying slender

This sweet of sweets is ours now
To wander through the land
Plucking an apple from its bough
To toss from hand to hand

No thing is certain joy nor sorrow
Except the hour we know it
Oh wear my heart today tomorrow
Who knows where the winds will blow it <|endoftext|>

Love leave me like the light
The gently passing day
We would not know but for the night
When it has slipped away

Go quietly a dream
When done should leave no trace
That it has lived except a gleam
Across the dreamer's face <|endoftext|>

Oh for a little while be kind to me
Who stand in such imperious need of you
And for a fitful space let my head lie
Happily on your passion's frigid breast
Although yourself no more resigned to me
Than on all bitter yesterdays I knew
This half a loaf from sumptuous crumbs your shy
Reneging hand lets fall shall make me blest
The sturdy homage of a love that throws
Its strength about you dawn and dusk at bed
And board is not for scorn When all is said
With final amen certitude who knows
But Dives found a matchless fragrance fled
When Lazarus no longer shocked his nose <|endoftext|>

What’s in this grave is worth your tear
There's more than the eye can see
Folly and Pride and Love lie here
Buried alive with me <|endoftext|>

My love
you are water upon water
upon water until it turns
azure mountainous

The horizon fills like sand
between glass marbles So much
has passed between us—

last night you told me
to press your hand
harder and harder as I pained

The sunset was at its last
embers The dark was stealing
the blue light from our room

I was falling into you <|endoftext|>

You’re doing a crossword
I’m working on a puzzle
Do you love me enough
What’s the missing word
Do I love you enough
Where’s the missing piece
Yesterday I was cross with you
You weren’t paying enough attention
You were cross with me
I wasn’t paying enough attention
Our words crossed
Where are the missing pieces
What are the missing words
Yet last night we fit together like words in a crossword
Pieces of a puzzle <|endoftext|>

I shall never have any fear of love 
Not of its depth nor its uttermost height
Its exquisite pain and its terrible delight
I shall never have any fear of love

I shall never hesitate to go down
Into the fastness of its abyss
Nor shrink from the cruelty of its awful kiss
I shall never have any fear of love

Never shall I dread love’s strength
Nor any pain it might give
Through all the years I may live
I shall never have any fear of love

I shall never draw back from love
Through fear of its vast pain
But build joy of it and count it again
I shall never have any fear of love

I shall never tremble nor flinch
From love’s moulding touch
I have loved too terribly and too much
Ever to have any fear of love <|endoftext|>

In the beginning there was your mouth
soft rose rose murmur murmured breath a warm

cardinal wind that drew my needle north
Magnetic flux the press of form to form 

In the beginning there was your mouth—
the trailhead the pathhead faintly opened

the canyon river carved farther south
and ahead the field the direction chosen

In the beginning there was your mouth
a sky full of stars raked or raking clock 

wise or west and in the close or mammoth 
matter my heart’s red muscle knocked and knocked

In the beginning there was your mouth
And nothing since but what the earth bears out <|endoftext|>

When my soul touches yours a great chord sings
How shall I tune it then to other things
O That some spot in darkness could be found
That does not vibrate when’er your depth sound
But everything that touches you and me
Welds us as played strings sound one melody
Where is the instrument whence the sounds flow
And whose the master hand that holds the bow
O Sweet song <|endoftext|>

If I had one more day
I would write a love poem
composed of one word
repeated like binary code

I’ll multiply it by the number
of days that passed 
without saying it to you
and I’ll add the days

when I said it with no words
because I want to say it 
more And like a bee 
gathering pollen I’ll collect 

everything ever said 
in one word like a square root
multiplied by the power of ten
I’ll count even that day

when my anger at you
or for you turned me into 
a stone and also the days 
when I was away

sending my songs like 
postcards to the lonely
feeling you in every touch 
of love I gave to the world

I’ll count all my days
even the nine months of days 
before I was born to say  
this exponential growing “I love you” <|endoftext|>

All night we danced upon our windy hill
Your dress a cloud of tangled midnight hair
And love was much too much for me to wear
My leaves the killer roared above his kill
But you danced on and when some star would spill
Its red and white upon you whirling there
I sensed a hidden beauty in the air
Though you danced on my heart and I stood still

But suddenly a bit of morning crept
Along your trembling sides of ebony
I saw the tears your tired limbs had wept
And how your breasts heaved high how languidly
Your dark arms moved I drew you close to me
We flung ourselves upon our hill and slept <|endoftext|>

That brown girl’s swagger gives a twitch
To beauty like a queen
Lad never dam your body’s itch
When loveliness is seen

For there is ample room for bliss
In pride in clean brown limbs
And lips know better how to kiss
Than how to raise white hymns

And when your body’s death gives birth
To soil for spring to crown
Men will not ask if that rare earth
Was white flesh once or brown <|endoftext|>

I love to see the big white moon 
A shining in the sky
I love to see the little stars 
When the shadow clouds go by

I love the rain drops falling
On my roof top in the night
I love the soft wind’s sighing 
Before the dawn’s gray light

I love the deepness of the blue 
In my Lord’s heaven above 
But better than all these things I think 
I love my lady love <|endoftext|>

There’s a new young moon riding the hills tonight 
There’s a sprightly young moon exploring the clouds 
There’s a half shy young moon veiling her face like a virgin 
Waiting for her lover <|endoftext|>

Because the bee
In my bonnet
Is the B in my bed
Who I can’t and I
Won’t stop bumping
We do the humpty
Hump My big nose
Nestled in her sassafras
At attention we round
Each other out At ease 
Her peach is a galaxy

Now and later is a square
I quietly hold on my tongue
My mouth an empty gesture 
Spaced out between her legs 
I am an astronaut
The gravity of my offense
Adds up to a rational number

When the heavens are free
From light I sit desire on my lap
She is stardust And I 
As it were am impossible  
When she asks for space
She is the future When she
Asks for a room it is the end 
I place before her chutes
Ladders and whatever else
Might fall from the sky <|endoftext|>

How desire is a thing I might die for Longing a well
a long dark throat Enter any body

of water and you give yourself up
to be swallowed Even the stones

know that I have writhed
against you as if against the black

bottom of a deep pool I have emerged
from your grip breathless

and slicked How easily
I could forget you

as separate so essential
you feel to me now You

beneath me like my own
blue shadow You silent as the moon

drifts like a petal
across your skin my mouth

to your lip—you a spring
I return to unquenchable and drink <|endoftext|>

Silence with you is like the faint delicious
Smile of a child asleep in dreams unguessed
Only the hinted wonder of its dreaming 
The soft slow breathing miracle of rest 
Silence with you is like a kind departure
From iron clangor and the engulfing crowd
Into a wide and greenly barren meadow 
Under the bloom of some blue bosomed cloud
Or like one held upon the sands at evening 
When the drawn tide rolls out and the mixed light 
Of sea and sky enshrouds the far wind bellowed
Sails that move darkly on the edge of night <|endoftext|>

When Lynne saw the lizard floating
in her mother in law’s swimming pool
she jumped in And when it wasn’t
breathing its body limp as a baby
drunk on milk she laid it on her palm
and pressed one fingertip to its silky breast
with just about the force you need
to test the ripeness of a peach only quicker
a brisk little push with a bit of spring in it
Then she knelt dripping wet in her Doc Martens
and camo T shirt with the neck ripped out
and bent her face to the lizard’s face
her big plush lips to the small stiff jaw
that she’d pried apart with her opposable thumb
and she blew a tiny puff into the lizard’s lungs
The sun glared against the turquoise water
What did it matter if she saved one lizard
One lizard more or less in the world
But she bestowed the kiss of life
again and again until
the lizard’s wrinkled lids peeled back
its muscles roused its own first breath
and she set it on the hot cement
where it rested a moment
before darting off <|endoftext|>

Sweetheart
when you break thru
you’ll find
a poet here
not quite what one would choose

I won’t promise
you’ll never go hungry
or that you won’t be sad
on this gutted
breaking
globe

but I can show you
baby
enough to love
to break your heart
forever <|endoftext|>

I like being with you all night with closed eyes
What luck—here you are
coming
along the stars
I did a road trip
all over my mind and heart
and
there you were
kneeling by the roadside
with your little toolkit
fixing something

Give me a world you have taken the world I was <|endoftext|>

I gaze into her eyes—their tender light
And strong illumes my spirit's darkest night
And pours rich glory on me as a star
Which brings its silver luster from afar

Sweet thoughts and beautiful within me burn
And heaven I see what way soe’er I turn
In borrowed radiance of her soulful glance
All things grow tenfold lovely and entrance

I touch her willing hand—as gentle dove
It rests within my own in trusting love
And yet it moves me with a power so deep
My heart is flame and all my pulses leap

I breathe her name unto the flowers they bloom
With rarer hues and shed more rich perfume
The skylark hears it as he floats along
And adds new sweetness to his morning song

Oh magic name deep graven on my heart
And as its owner of myself a part
It hath in all my daily thoughts a share
And forms the burden of my nightly prayer <|endoftext|>

Autumn eats its leaf out of my hand we are friends
We shell time from the nuts and teach it to walk
time returns to the shell

In the mirror is Sunday
in the dream we sleep
the mouth speaks true

My eye goes down to my lover’s sex
we gaze at each other
we speak of dark things

we love each other like poppy and memory
we sleep like wine in the seashells
like the sea in the moon’s blood beam

We stand and embrace at the window they watch us from the street
it is time for this to be known
It is time that the stone took the trouble to bloom
that unrest’s heart started to beat
It’s time for it to be time

It is time <|endoftext|>

She said it softly without a need 
for conviction or romance
After everything I asked ashamed 

That's not the kind of love she meant
She walked through a field of gray 
beetle pored pine snags branching

like polished bone I forget sometimes
how trees look at me with the generosity 
of water I forget all the other 

breath I'm breathing in 
Today I learned that trees can't sleep
with our lights on That they knit 

a forest in their language their feelings 
This is not a metaphor 
Like seeing a face across a crowd 

we are learning all the old things 
newly shined and numbered 
I'm always looking 

for a place to lie down
and cry Green mossed shaded 
Or rock quiet empty Somewhere

to hush and start over 
I put on my antlers in the sun 
I walk through the dark gates of the trees 

Grief waters my footsteps leaving 
a trail that glistens <|endoftext|>

Outside an abandoned mattress sags with rain
and the driveway turns all sludge when I remember
I could’ve died eight years ago in a bed
smaller than the one I share with a new lover
who just this morning found another grey hair in my afro
and before resettling the wiry curl with the others
kissed the freckle on my forehead
I admit I don’t know a love that doesn’t
destroy Last night while we slept
a mouse drowned in the rice pot
I left soaking in the sink I tried
to make a metaphor out of this the way
he took the mouse to the edge of the lake in the yard
released it to a deeper grave It was
an anniversary just my lover
taking a dead thing away taking it
somewhere I couldn’t see <|endoftext|>

Come “Will” let’s be good friends again 
Our wrongs let’s be forgetting 
For words bring only useless pain 
So wherefore then be fretting 

Let’s lay aside imagined wrongs 
And ne’er give way to grieving
Life should be filled with joyous songs 
No time left for deceiving 

I’ll try and not give way to wrath 
Nor be so often crying 
There must some thorns be in our path 
Let’s move them now by trying 

How like a foolish pair were we 
To fume about a letter 
Time is so precious you and me 
Must spend ours doing better <|endoftext|>

Watch the dewdrops in the morning
Shake their little diamond heads
Sparkling flashing ever moving
From their silent little beds

See the grass Each blade is brightened
Roots are strengthened by their stay
Like the dewdrops let us scatter
Gems of love along the way <|endoftext|>

As I lie in bed
Flat on my back
There passes across my ceiling
An endless panorama of things—
Quick steps of gay voiced children
Adolescence in its wondering silences
Maid and man on moonlit summer’s eve
Women in the holy glow of Motherhood
Old men gazing silently thru the twilight
Into the beyond
O God give me words to make my dream children live <|endoftext|>

O come Love let us take a walk
Down the Way of Life together
Storms may come but what care we
If be fair or foul the weather

When the sky overhead is blue
Balmy scented winds will after
Us adown the valley blow
Haunting echoes of our laughter

When Life’s storms upon us beat
Crushing us with fury after
All is done there’ll ringing come
Mocking echoes of our laughter

So we’ll walk the Way of Life
You and I Love both together
Storm or sunshine happy we
If be foul or fair the weather <|endoftext|>

I saw you as I passed last night
Framed in a sky of gold
And through the sun’s fast paling light
You seemed a queen of old
Whose smile was light to all the world
Against the crowding dark
And in my soul a song there purled—
Re echoed by the lark

I saw you as I passed last night
Your tresses burnished gold
While in your eyes a happy bright
Gleam of your friendship told
And I went singing on my way
On on into the dark
But in my heart still shone the day
And still—still sang the lark <|endoftext|>

I do not crave to have thee mine alone dear
Keeping thy charms within my jealous sight
Go give the world the blessing of thy beauty
That other hearts may share of my delight

I do not ask thy love should be mine only
While others falter through the dreary night
Go kiss the tears from some wayfarer’s vision 
That other eyes may know the joy of light

Where days are sad and skies are hung with darkness 
Go send a smile that sunshine may be rife
Go give a song a word of kindly greeting 
To ease the sorrow of some lonely life <|endoftext|>

When buffeted and beaten by life’s storms
When by the bitter cares of life oppressed
I want no surer haven than your arms
I want no sweeter heaven than your breast

When over my life’s way there falls the blight
Of sunless days and nights of starless skies
Enough for me the calm and steadfast light
That softly shines within your loving eyes

The world for me and all the world can hold
Is circled by your arms for me there lies
Within the lights and shadows of your eyes
The only beauty that is never old <|endoftext|>

Gather up whatever is 
glittering in the gutter
whatever has tumbled 
in the waves or fallen 
in flames out of the sky

for it’s not only our
hearts that are broken 
but the heart
of the world as well
Stitch it back together 

Make a place where
the day speaks to the night
and the earth speaks to the sky
Whether we created God
or God created us

it all comes down to this
In our imperfect world
we are meant to repair
and stitch together 
what beauty there is stitch it 

with compassion and wire 
See how everything 
we have made gathers 
the light inside itself
and overflows A blessing <|endoftext|>

I will hide my soul and its mighty love 
In the bosom of this rose
And its dispensing breath will take 
My love wherever it goes

And perhaps she’ll pluck this very rose
And quick as blushes start
Will breathe my hidden secret in
Her unsuspecting heart 

And there I will live in her embrace
And the realm of sweetness there
Enamored with an ecstasy
Of bliss beyond compare  <|endoftext|>

You looked inside
For what the perishable flesh might hide 
And now you say that inner part
Will represent her in my heart 

I tell you no
Philosopher I say I loved her so
I did not dig within—content
When seasons came when seasons went

When she would frown
You think I set the meaning of it down
The meaning goes but something stays
I shall have with me all my days—

Her forehead bare
One instant then blown over by her hair 
A sudden turn her hand at rest
Upon a window toward the west <|endoftext|>

You on the bed beside me hold
One arm straight up till it is cold
Then let it fall the softest part
Lying for warmth against my heart 
My fingers with your fingers’ ends
Play in and out a foot defends 
Deep regions from another foot 
You turn and find my eyes  I put
A curious palm where it is seized
By a quick hand—but you are pleased    
There is a third one in the room 
See—in the sun where the figures bloom
Blood red on the rug—somebody kneels 
Time smiles at us and rests his heels 
Outside a hundred horses graze 
He will drive on but now he stays 
Soon I must follow hence and slip
Into my place beneath the whip    
He smiles upon us  Come forget
He has not thought of rising yet <|endoftext|>

Life is but a troubled ocean 
Hope a meteor love a flower
Which blossoms in the morning beam 
And whithers with the evening hour 

Ambition is a dizzy height 
And glory but a lightning gleam 
Fame is a bubble dazzling bright 
Which fairest shines in fortune’s beam 

When clouds and darkness veil the skies 
And sorrow’s blast blows loud and chill 
Friendship shall like a rainbow rise 
And softly whisper—peace be still <|endoftext|>

Yesterday I held your hand
Reverently I pressed it
And its gentle yieldingness
From my soul I blessed it

But to day I sit alone
Sad and sore repining
Must our gold forever know
Flames for the refining

Yesterday I walked with you
Could a day be sweeter
Life was all a lyric song
Set to tricksy meter

Ah to day is like a dirge—
Place my arms around you
Let me feel the same dear joy
As when first I found you

Let me once retrace my steps
From these roads unpleasant
Let my heart and mind and soul
All ignore the present

Yesterday the iron seared
And to day means sorrow
Pause my soul arise arise
Look where gleams the morrow <|endoftext|>

I found you and I lost you 
All on a gleaming day 
The day was filled with sunshine
And the land was full of May 

A golden bird was singing
Its melody divine 
I found you and I loved you 
And all the world was mine 

I found you and I lost you 
All on a golden day 
But when I dream of you dear 
It is always brimming May <|endoftext|>

The Octopus offers me one of his three hearts

briar and holly for friendship the second and third

saved for times of longing times of loss

A strange romance I admit—

Friends would never approve or believe

yet he was untouched by human hands

How can we say this is not a source of wonder—

“Who will sing my song if not you”  he asked

“Who will dream of me as I lay under the stillness of water”

Even an Octopus can be eloquent and then again

as we know enormous need can become power

What am I supposed to do now

I stand by the water

my woolen dress unraveling in the waves <|endoftext|>

The monotone of the rain is beautiful
And the sudden rise and slow relapse
Of the long multitudinous rain

The sun on the hills is beautiful
Or a captured sunset sea flung
Bannered with fire and gold

A face I know is beautiful
With fire and gold of sky and sea
And the peace of long warm rain <|endoftext|>

Love is a rainbow that appears
When heaven’s sunshine lights earth’s tears

All varied colors of the light
Within its beauteous arch unite

There Passion’s glowing crimson hue
Burns near Truth’s rich and deathless blue

And Jealousy’s green lights unfold
‘Mid Pleasure’s tints of flame and gold

O dark life’s stormy sky would seem
If love’s clear rainbow did not gleam <|endoftext|>

there’s no taking it back now
What comes next Charcoal underbone 

darkroom for soliloquy  irises wide
at home Some underside party popping

off  ending with me counting resignations
on a couch made from my last pennies—

copper profiles cushion deep dull 
with emancipation  worth almost me

Button nicks instead of eyes Green
patina instead of skin over presidential 

profiles How to separate these awkward
exhales from the marinating revivals

The song in the park across the street
dials up something endless about love

 big sunflowers but I can’t split
this primal reflection from its primary 

leather Sneakers  skeletons arrhythmic
in their leaving  squeaking twisting

in somebody else’s garden in the middle
of a cracked city near a river so thick

with its own beat up history it’s already
eye level to the flocking blackbirds <|endoftext|>

This poem is not usually like this
I don’t know what came over it
It’s mostly violet under the sun
with a large yellow parasol and a pond
with a center that never freezes
I swear I had no idea
I’m so used to trees of hearts and
cherries within its branches
I can’t imagine
what woke this poem up
with a truth I never wanted
It called out the tower window and said
I was alone
That in itself is a morbid lie
I have long shadows in Autumn and clouds
anytime there is a sky
In fact everything was going so well until
this poem wanted to undress me
and bring back my love
and hold me close and rub
my forehead when I had fever
It had no idea what trouble could come
from this so I wrote it
then I ran from it
now I can erase it
to show I never needed it after all
because don’t you know Poem
if you have to ask for something
it’s no gift <|endoftext|>

You lay so still in the sunshine
So still in that hot sweet hour—
That the timid things of the forest land
Came close a butterfly lit on your hand
Mistaking it for a flower

You scarcely breathed in your slumber
So dreamless it was so deep—
While the warm air stirred in my veins like wine
The air that had blown through a jasmine vine
But you slept—and I let you sleep <|endoftext|>

A black chinned hummingbird lands 
on a metal wire and rests for five seconds 
for five seconds a pianist lowers his head 
and rests his hands on the keys 

a man bathes where irrigation water 
forms a pool before it drains into the river
a mechanic untwists a plug and engine oil 
drains into a bucket for five seconds 

I smell peppermint through an open window
recall where a wild leaf grazed your skin
here touch comes before sight holding you 
I recall across a canal the sounds of men 

laying cuttlefish on ice at first light
before first light physical contact 
our hearts beating patter of female rain 
on the roof as the hummingbird 

whirrs out of sight the gears of a clock 
mesh at varying speeds we hear 
a series of ostinato notes and are not tied
to our bodies’ weight on earth <|endoftext|>

When Milo was a kitten 
and spent the night
with us in the big bed
curled like a brown sock
at our feet he would
wake before daybreak
squeak plaintively 
in his best Burmese
cat castrato soprano
and make bread on our stomachs
until if one of us did not rise
sleep walk to the kitchen
and open his can of food
he would steal under the covers
crouch run hard at us
jam his head
in our armpits
and burrow fiercely

Probably he meant nothing by that
Or he meant it in cat contrary
just as he did not intend
drawing blood the day
he bolted out the door
and was wild again
for nearly three hours
I could not catch him
until I knelt wormed
into the crawl space
under a neighbor house
and lured him home
with bits of dried fish

Or he meant exactly what he smelled
and smelled the future
as it transmogrified out of the past
for he is if not an olfactory
clairvoyant
a highly nuanced cat—
an undoer of complicated knots
who tricks cabinets
who lives to upend tall
glasses of Merlot
With his whole body
he has censored the finest passages of Moby Dick
He has silenced Beethoven with one paw
He has leapt three and a half feet
from the table by the wall
and pulled down
your favorite print by Milo
He does not know the word no

When you asked the vet what 
kind of cat it was she went
into the next room
came back and said
“Havana Brown”

The yellow eyes the voice
the live spirit that plays into dead seriousness
and will not be punished into goodness
but no—

an ancient nameless breed—

mink he says and I answer in cat
Even if I was not
born in a dumpster 
between a moldy cabbage
and an expired loaf of bread
I too was rescued by an extravagant woman <|endoftext|>

Such are the little memories of you
They come and go return and lie apart
From all main things of life yet more than they
With noiseless feet they come and grip the heart
Gay laughter leading quick and stormy tears
Then smiles again and pulse of flying feet
In breathless chase of fleeting gossamers
Are memories so dear so bitter sweet

No more are echoes of your flying feet
Hard by where Pike’s Peak rears its head in state
The erstwhile rushing feet with halting steps
For health’s return in Denver watch and wait
But love and memories of noiseless tread
Where angels hovered once all shining fair
To tuck you in your little trundle bed
Kneel nightly now in agony of prayer <|endoftext|>

We used to say
That’s my heart right there

As if to say
Don’t mess with her right there

As if don’t even play
That’s a part of me right there

In other words okay okay
That’s the start of me right there

As if come that day
That’s the end of me right there

As if push come to shove
I would fend for her right there

As if come what may
I would lie for her right there

As if come love to pay
I would die for that right there <|endoftext|>

We walk through clouds
wrapped in ancient symbols

We descend the hill
wearing water 

Maybe we are dead 
and don’t know it

Maybe we are violet flowers
and those we long for 

love only 
our unmade hearts

On attend on attend

Wait for Duras and Eminescu 
to tell us in French then Romanian

light has wounds
slow down—
memory is misgivings 

Wait until the nails
get rusty 
in the houses of our past <|endoftext|>

turns out
there are more planets than stars
more places to land
than to be burned

I have always been in love with
last chances especially 
now that they really do 
seem like last chances

the trill of it all upending
what’s left of my head
after we explode

are you ready to ascend
in the morning I will take you
on the wing <|endoftext|>

Staring at the stars
I imagine you
vanished and dispersed
in that unreachable
clarity of light
They glisten sharp and cold
vast distances apart
yet coming to their marks
the same time every night
of their season

The seasons slowly move
carrying their forms—
I recognize so few
Orion with his belt
dominating winter
a wobbly W
the dipper’s angled box
and handle each bright dot
individually
jeweled there

Nothing there is fixed
not even that clear star
that seems always to point
just one way as it speeds
farther and farther off
All of them are whirling
on their separate paths
circles and ellipses
poles of radiance
that spread the dark

What can be made of that
If you are nothing now
but memory the stars
seem a proper home
Long after the sun
swells to disperse the earth
they’ll change as you have
light vanishing with time
light beyond the reach
of light itself

Staring at the light
an explosion sent
from some place nowhere now
I know it will outlast
whatever I become
Imagining its end
I see it moving still
when nothing can be seen
and we are both nothing
everywhere <|endoftext|>

The first time I kissed
It was my girlfriends who kissed
They invented a flavor a style a smell
My lips weren't there

The first time I kissed
The prince was chosen by these dreaming girls
He was a jerk to me
A toad a dragon that spat its fire on me

I don't know what it was like
They didn't see my closed eyes
I wasn't there <|endoftext|>

Never never may the fruit be plucked from the bough
And gathered into barrels
He that would eat of love must eat it where it hangs
Though the branches bend like reeds
Though the ripe fruit splash in the grass or wrinkle on the tree
He that would eat of love may bear away with him
Only what his belly can hold
Nothing in the apron
Nothing in the pockets
Never never may the fruit be gathered from the bough
And harvested in barrels
The winter of love is a cellar of empty bins
In an orchard soft with rot <|endoftext|>

My love is as ancient as my blood

And of course my blood is still mine

because a woman sweetened black

with good song pulled me from the river

like an axe pulled back from the bark

I learned love first as scar

And of course my love is only mine

because I found the nerve to say it is

Ha My love is mine

But was first my mother’s Not the how

but the why But was first her mother’s

Not the how but the why

Not the how Not the how Not the how
Not the how Not the how Not the how

I am bored with this beat I seek

a different dance toward death

Lord listen up Lean in

I crave a love that happens as sweetly

as it was named If love must be swung

let it soften Not split <|endoftext|>

Underneath your skin your heart
moves  Your chest
rises at its touch  A small bump
appears every
second  We watch for what appears
to be hours

Our hands log the time the soft
light darkness
underneath your eyes  Our bodies
intersect like highways
with limitless access and perfect spans
of attention

We pay for this later  I pay
for breakfast  We
can’t stay long  We take off
to the museum
and watch the individual colors
as they surface

in the late works of Matisse
They move the way
your heart moves the way we breathe
You draw your own
breath then I draw mine  This is
truly great art <|endoftext|>

I dreamt—before death made such dreaming vain—
That sometime on a day of wind and rain
I would come home to you at fall of night
And see your window flushed with firelight
There in the chill dark lonesomeness I’d wait
A moment standing at the garden gate
Scarce trusting that my happiness was true—
The kind warm lights of home and love and you

Then lest they’d vanish to be mine no more
I’d speed my steps along the garden path
Cross my own threshold close the wind blown door
And find you in the firelight of the hearth
O happiness to kneel beside you there
And feel your fingers resting on my hair <|endoftext|>

Give me hunger
O you gods that sit and give
The world its orders
Give me hunger pain and want
Shut me out with shame and failure
From your doors of gold and fame
Give me your shabbiest weariest hunger

But leave me a little love
A voice to speak to me in the day end
A hand to touch me in the dark room
Breaking the long loneliness
In the dusk of day shapes
Blurring the sunset
One little wandering western star
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow
Let me go to the window
Watch there the day shapes of dusk
And wait and know the coming
Of a little love <|endoftext|>

You said bad men waited inside
your mouth which meant a fire
 
was catching We drove toward
a cloud of smoke that rose above
 
the city In the mirror I saw
the wide belt strapped across
 
your chest and on the radio
men stormed the gates
 
in another country I do
love you you said looking out
 
The window held the sun
flatly I held my breath The brush
 
had not been cleared in weeks
and the mountain prepared to burn <|endoftext|>

Her eyes were mostly shut She didn’t speak
The sun’s slow exile crossed the wall above the bed

But once when I bent to feed her a drop
of morphine from the little plastic beak

her hand shot up and gripped my arm She looked right at me
When she said the words it sounded like she meant Don't leave me

From the very first we love like this our heads turning
toward whatever mothers us our mouths urgent

for the taste of our name <|endoftext|>

She’s saying
I wish there could be a metaphorical
investigative committee
and I’m saying
therapy or a priest

and behind us
the excellence of bright children

and on our walk home
the left glove

and I’m saying
I’m fueled by kissing and crimes
against the environment

and she’s saying
the cat shaped depression in this cushion

the necessity of the cat

and I’m saying
I’ve never met a silk sheet I didn’t want to ruin

and at home
the fingerprints disappearing
from your grandfather’s coat

the way we carve people out like water through a rock face
the way we read it on their faces
like laundry lines
like clouds <|endoftext|>

Light drifts across the ceiling
as if we are under water

whoever would approach you
you changed the comer

You holding on to the front of my coat
with both hands the last time I saw you

I felt your death coming close
the change in your red lips

You gave me your hand
You pulled me out of the ground <|endoftext|>

Because the road was steep and long
And through a dark and lonely land
God set upon my lips a song
And put a lantern in my hand

Through miles on weary miles of night
That stretch relentless in my way
My lantern burns serene and white
An unexhausted cup of day

O golden lights and lights like wine
How dim your boasted splendors are
Behold this little lamp of mind
It is more starlike than a star <|endoftext|>

No state is enviable To the luck alone
Of some few favoured men I would put claim
I bleed but her who wounds I will not blame
Have I not felt her heart as ’t were my own
Beat thro’ me could I hurt her heaven and hell
But I could hurt her cruelly Can I let 
My Love’s old time piece to another set
Swear it can’t stop and must for ever swell
Sure that’s one way Love drifts into the mart
Where goat legged buyers throng I see not plain
My meaning is it must not be again
Great God the maddest gambler throws his heart
If any state be enviable on earth
’Tis yon born idiot’s who as days go by
Still rubs his hands before him like a fly
In a queer sort of meditative mirth <|endoftext|>

All other joys of life he strove to warm
And magnify and catch them to his lip
But they had suffered shipwreck with the ship
And gazed upon him sallow from the storm
Or if Delusion came ’t was but to show
The coming minute mock the one that went
Cold as a mountain in its star pitched tent
Stood high Philosophy less friend than foe
Whom self caged Passion from its prison bars
Is always watching with a wondering hate
Not till the fire is dying in the grate
Look we for any kinship with the stars
Oh wisdom never comes when it is gold
And the great price we pay for it full worth
We have it only when we are half earth
Little avails that coinage to the old <|endoftext|>

It chanced his lips did meet her forehead cool
She had no blush but slanted down her eye
Shamed nature then confesses love can die
And most she punishes the tender fool
Who will believe what honours her the most
Dead is it dead She has a pulse and flow
Of tears the price of blood drops as I know
For whom the midnight sobs around Love’s ghost
Since then I heard her and so will sob on
The love is here it has but changed its aim
O bitter barren woman what’s the name
The name the name the new name thou hast won
Behold me striking the world’s coward stroke
That will I not do though the sting is dire
—Beneath the surface this while by the fire
They sat she laughing at a quiet joke <|endoftext|>

A diamond of a morning
Waked me an hour too soon
Dawn had taken in the stars
And left the faint white moon
 
O white moon you are lonely
It is the same with me
But we have the world to roam over
Only the lonely are free <|endoftext|>

Weak motion of grasses and tern before the sea
Worry’s school cresting here and everywhere
as failings
 
I pace the cliff path my hands cupped above my eyes
The glare steals your progress a kayak needling
the wide open
 
Love means you answer this the child’s rebuke
A pattern crosses the point hemming
the horizon steamship
 
I didn’t know you were the green pitch
unable to beat the storm to shore
You didn’t know I was the lookout
 
Get accustomed to the sad girl picking you
out of the sea the knot caught in her throat
and the unraveling of her speech an endless rope
thrown out of me <|endoftext|>

I have always hated the rain
And the gloom of grayed skies
But now I think I must always cherish
Rain hung leaf and the misty river
And the friendly screen of dripping green
Where eager kisses were shyly given
And your pipe smoke made clouds in our damp close heaven
 
The curious laggard passed us by
His wet shoes soughed on the shining walk
And that afternoon was filled with a blurred glory
That afternoon when we first talked as lovers <|endoftext|>

Walk into the world
Go into the places of trade
Go into the smiling country
But go clad wrapped closely always
Shielded and sustained
In the visible flame of my love
 
Let it blaze about you
A glowing armor for all to see
Flashing around your head
A tender and valiant halo
 
I think there will be many to wonder
And many to stand in awe and envy
But surely no one will come too close to you
No one will dare to claim you
Hand or heart
As you pass in your shining and terrible garment <|endoftext|>

If my love for you were a teacup
I would praise it for its blue I’d consider
Its delicate handle the pictures painted there
Of ladies of their parasols
But my love is not a teacup
 
It is not even the tar pit from which we draw
Fodder for the desolate streets oh lightless at night
Oh pathways asking for feet and their memory
It is not even a tugboat going
Bravely into morning carrying cordage and salt
 
Nor that saddest sickest animal
In the zoo carious mangy whose hair molts
Who with its wounds sits in the bare
Hay padded corner of a cell and licks
At the question of what it means to be here
 
Yet in winter my love is covered with the brightness
Of snow in winter my love is filled with eyes
It waits for me at the block’s edge
Habitual dog who walks me back into that gaseous
Entity we call life Others’ loves may wink and smile
 
Like the moon through a resurrection of vapors
Like the coy and barbarous moon who knows no allegiance
But my love is more like an ice sculpture
In a country of perpetual coldness which the heat
Of your anger cannot damage nor the pick
 
Of your words impugn Now
Lay your worry aside from you stranger
Put your hands near these curves do you feel
That hallowed temperature Among my people
We call this absolute love <|endoftext|>

In my dreams I’m always hovering
before the evening primroses

their centers of ruby gold and bent
stalks whispering praise to me

It’s always prelude playing here
bee edicts echoing down days

stung to silence under gauzy clouds
slivered moons and in steam

rising from pollen My portly
body taxis in repose I fall

in love Each night I deeper fall
my buzzing swarm swaddled

alike in dreams We are fuzzy
monks deep in contemplation

on mountains of mere wind
Our feet frizzle in prayer Nectar

rolls in our mouths like honey
withheld I am orotund rapture

that is me to thee dancing on nothing
substantial swaying in my stripes on thick air <|endoftext|>

Four lanes over a plump helium heart—

slipped maybe from some kid’s wrist
or a rushed lover’s empty passenger seat

through a half cracked car window—

rises like a shiny purple cloudlet
toward today’s gray mess of clouds

trailing its gold ribbon like lightning

that will never strike anything
or anyone here on the forsaken ground

its bold LOVE increasingly illegible

as it ascends over the frozen oaks
riding swift currents toward the horizon

a swollen word wobbling out of sight <|endoftext|>

It flares up at sunrise a blush in a bramble
Tumbling out of its bed by the city pavement—a single
Rose coral heat at the end of the season			
And you are drawn to it to its scent its silky
Layers to its core It gathers you into its 
Body until you lose your balance all you can see	
Is a petaled grid an endless repetition
Of roses You sink swirling into the rose
Deep into the rose into the rose
I hold you to me Love I am forty four 
And you love you my love
You have planted me <|endoftext|>

You are beautiful and faded
Like an old opera tune
Played upon a harpsichord
Or like the sun flooded silks
Of an eighteenth century boudoir In your eyes
Smoulder the fallen roses of outlived minutes
And the perfume of your soul
Is vague and suffusing
With the pungence of sealed spice jars
Your half tones delight me
And I grow mad with gazing
At your blent colors

My vigor is a new minted penny
Which I cast at your feet
Gather it up from the dust
That its sparkle may amuse you <|endoftext|>

On the day they killed the last caribou
I was in love—and I did not know
caribou or cities or the needs of either

I did not know scilla and did not know a new love
would be hired to trim the grass around it The blue flowers
came up through the grass like the grass remembering

This new love and I we drove once between cities of snow
and through the trees I could see a herd moving
matching us pulling away <|endoftext|>

The city is peopled
with spirits not ghosts O my love

Though they crowded between
and usurped the kiss of my mouth
their breath was your gift
their beauty your life <|endoftext|>

Love is a breach in the walls a broken gate
Where that comes in that shall not go again
Love sells the proud heart’s citadel to Fate
They have known shame who love unloved Even then
When two mouths thirsty each for each find slaking
And agony’s forgot and hushed the crying
Of credulous hearts in heaven—such are but taking
Their own poor dreams within their arms and lying
Each in his lonely night each with a ghost
Some share that night But they know love grows colder
Grows false and dull that was sweet lies at most
Astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder
But darkens and dies out from kiss to kiss
All this is love and all love is but this <|endoftext|>

I cut myself upon the thought of you
And yet I come back to it again and again
A kind of fury makes me want to draw you out
From the dimness of the present
And set you sharply above me in a wheel of roses
Then going obviously to inhale their fragrance
I touch the blade of you and cling upon it
And only when the blood runs out across my fingers
Am I at all satisfied <|endoftext|>

My mother wouldn’t stand up
to wave My father made certain
the door locked behind me

But when I went for your door
you came too Your mouth
made a flute of my arm

its music a glass on the past
My love my love went its song
Now there is no need to leave <|endoftext|>

We might have coupled
In the bed ridden monopoly of a moment
Or broken flesh with one another
At the profane communion table
Where wine is spilled on promiscuous lips

We might have given birth to a butterfly
With the daily news
Printed in blood on its wings <|endoftext|>

I would have each couple turn
join and unjoin be lost
in the greater turning
of other couples woven
in the circle of a dance
the song of long time flowing

over them so they may return
turn again in to themselves
out of desire greater than their own
belonging to all to each
to the dance and to the song
that moves them through the night

What is fidelity To what
does it hold The point
of departure or the turning road
that is departure and absence
and the way home What we are
and what we were once

are far estranged For those
who would not change time
is infidelity But we are married
until death and are betrothed
to change By silence so
I learn my song I earn

my sunny fields by absence once
and to come And I love you
as I love the dance that brings you
out of the multitude
in which you come and go
Love changes and in change is true <|endoftext|>

And what is love It is a doll dress’d up
For idleness to cosset nurse and dandle
A thing of soft misnomers so divine
That silly youth doth think to make itself
Divine by loving and so goes on
Yawning and doting a whole summer long
Till Miss’s comb is made a pearl tiara
And common Wellingtons turn Romeo boots
Then Cleopatra lives at number seven
And Antony resides in Brunswick Square
Fools if some passions high have warm’d the world
If Queens and Soldiers have play’d deep for hearts
It is no reason why such agonies
Should be more common than the growth of weeds
Fools make me whole again that weighty pearl
The Queen of Egypt melted and I’ll say
That ye may love in spite of beaver hats <|endoftext|>

Epithalamion Not too long back
I was being ironic about “wives”
It’s very well to say creation thrives
on contradiction but that’s a fast track
shifted precipitately into Tacky
some might say and look mildly appalled On
the whole it’s one I’m likely to be called on
Explain yourself or face the music Hack
No law books frame terms of this covenant
It’s choice that’s asymptotic to a goal
which means that we must choose and choose and choose
momently daily This moment my whole
trajectory’s toward you and it’s not losing
momentum Call it anything we want <|endoftext|>

I hid my love when young till I
Couldn’t bear the buzzing of a fly
I hid my love to my despite
Till I could not bear to look at light
I dare not gaze upon her face
But left her memory in each place
Where’er I saw a wild flower lie
I kissed and bade my love good bye

I met her in the greenest dells
Where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells
The lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye
The bee kissed and went singing by
A sunbeam found a passage there
A gold chain round her neck so fair
As secret as the wild bee’s song
She lay there all the summer long

I hid my love in field and town
Till e’en the breeze would knock me down
The bees seemed singing ballads o’er
The fly’s bass turned a lion’s roar
And even silence found a tongue
To haunt me all the summer long
The riddle nature could not prove
Was nothing else but secret love <|endoftext|>

Light so low upon earth 
You send a flash to the sun 
Here is the golden close of love 
All my wooing is done 
O all the woods and the meadows 
Woods where we hid from the wet 
Stiles where we stay'd to be kind 
Meadows in which we met 
Light so low in the vale 
You flash and lighten afar
For this is the golden morning of love 
And you are his morning star 
Flash I am coming I come 
By meadow and stile and wood
Oh lighten into my eyes and my heart 
Into my heart and my blood 
Heart are you great enough 
For a love that never tires 
O heart are you great enough for love 
I have heard of thorns and briers 
Over the thorns and briers 
Over the meadows and stiles 
Over the world to the end of it 
Flash of a million miles <|endoftext|>

Love comes quietly
finally drops
about me on me
in the old ways

What did I know
thinking myself
able to go
alone all the way <|endoftext|>

Which cannot be written tries anyway
From one room to another each time startled
And does not want to hear of the already

Passed through the country of before
Poem that at each door believes itself
In the room closest to the end

Where finally everything will be gone over
Dismantled held up carefully laid back down
While talked into the beauty which can turn

In a minute To hear of every other
Poem written is to begin
Revision and what cannot be left enough

Alone and so the lovers look at each other
Until none else can come near Poem
Which never wanted anything but this

Tries anyway so brave unable to know where
She heads unwrapping until only a gift
Which cannot be given as it cannot be let go <|endoftext|>
