Love a fire that never fades
Through all seasons in cascades
Your smile a sunlit ray
Lighting up my darkest day

Love a melody in the silence
Echoes of passion sweet and intense
In your eyes constellations align
A universe of feelings forever thine
Your touch a sonnet in every embrace
In love's embrace we find our grace
Moonlight whispers secrets untold
In the language of hearts our story unfolds
Together we paint a canvas of dreams
Love's symphony in infinite streams
In your laughter the joy of a sunrise
Our love a journey with no goodbyes
Love the eternal flame that won't cease
In your arms my heart finds its peace

Love a symphony in the heart's embrace
Whispers of passion a timeless grace
In your eyes galaxies of dreams unfold
A canvas painted in hues of love untold
Your touch a melody that dances on the skin
Igniting sparks a flame that burns within
Moonlight serenades a gentle caress
In the realm of love where feelings confess
Together we sail on waves of affection
A journey guided by the stars' reflection
In your arms I find a haven so divine
Love's tapestry woven forever thine
Sunsets fade but our love remains
A harmonious melody free from chains
Love an eternal vow whispered in the night
A timeless story in each other's light

Love a whisper in the moonlit night
Your smile a symphony of delight
In your eyes stars find their place
Our love story a timeless embrace

Love a timeless river that gently flows
In its currents our shared story glows
Your laughter the melody in the air
In the book of love our chapters rare
In your eyes constellations align
A universe of feelings so divine
Your touch a gentle breeze's embrace
Love's poetry written on every trace
Moonlit nights where dreams conspire
Our hearts dance fueled by love's fire
In the symphony of us notes entwine
Love the eternal where souls intertwine

Love a magical hug that's always near
In your laughter joy becomes clear
Your tiny hands in mine they find
A world of wonder pure and kind
In your eyes a universe so bright
Filled with dreams that take flight
Love a lullaby in every goodnight
Guiding you through dreams so light
Giggles and games love's sweet refrain
In every sunbeam and gentle rain
In your world where innocence weaves
Love whispers in the rustling leaves
You're a treasure a gift from above
In your heart a garden of love
With every step as you grow and play
Love is the sunshine lighting your way

Love a bond that time can't erase
In your friendship a warm embrace
Your laughter a melody so sweet
In every moment our spirits meet
In the journey of life side by side
Love a constant a trusted guide
Through highs and lows thick and thin
Our shared adventures where love begins
You're the sunshine in cloudy weather
In our story friends forever
Love the thread that weaves us strong
In your friendship where I belong

Love a fragile rose with thorns concealed
In the garden of the heart wounds revealed
Petals of joy once vibrant now fade
A melancholy symphony love's serenade
Whispers of promises lost in the night
Fading echoes of a love once so bright
Tears like raindrops on the window pane
A sad love's ballad sung in silent pain
Memories linger like shadows they persist
A bittersweet ache a clenched fist
In the canvas of love strokes of despair
A masterpiece tainted beyond repair
Heartbeats syncopate to a somber tune
In the melancholy of a deserted moon
Love a poem written in shades of gray
Fading slowly with each passing day
Yet in sadness a glimmer of hope remains
Love's ember flickers despite the chains
For even in sorrow love finds a way
To resurrect to endure to forever stay

Love unfolds
A story of passion in hues untold
Your eyes the stars in my midnight sky
A cosmic dance where our spirits fly
Your touch a gentle breeze that caresses my soul
In its soft whispers love takes control
With every heartbeat a symphony plays
A melody of love that brightens my days
In the garden of emotions our love takes root
Blossoming with tenderness bearing sweet fruit
Your laughter a melody that dances in the air
A serenade of joy beyond compare
Hand in hand we navigate life's winding road
Love the compass where our hearts are stowed
In the quiet moments and the storms we weather
Our love an unbreakable bond tied together
So here's to us to the love we share
A flame that glows a bond so rare
In the poetry of us every word is true
A timeless love forever me and you

Love a voyage on an uncharted sea
In your eyes the compass guiding me
Through storms and calm our ship sails true
A love that endures forever in view
So here's to love in its purest form
An eternal flame ever warm
In the poetry of us a verse so fine
A love that transcends an endless line
