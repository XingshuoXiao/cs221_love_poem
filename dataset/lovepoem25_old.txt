Because of you in gardens of blossoming
Flowers I ache from the perfumes of spring
I have forgotten your face I no longer
Remember your hands how did your lips
Feel on mine

Because of you I love the white statues
Drowsing in the parks the white statues that
Have neither voice nor sight

I have forgotten your voice your happy voice
I have forgotten your eyes

Like a flower to its perfume I am bound to
My vague memory of you I live with pain
That is like a wound if you touch me you will
Make to me an irreperable harm

Your caresses enfold me like climbing
Vines on melancholy walls

I have forgotten your love yet I seem to
Glimpse you in every window

Because of you the heady perfumes of
Summer pain me because of you I again
Seek out the signs that precipitate desires
Shooting stars falling objects<|endoftext|>

thick and beautiful
long golden hair
tied back in a messy bun
with a red hair band

wide green eyes
hidden behind thick lashes
and black rimmed glasses
with a hint of eyeliner

small delicate button nose
with a full mouth
filled with teeth as white as snow
held back with braces

slim frame with a huge pink sweater
tight black jeans with zippers
pink high heeled boots with buckles
a small handbag filled with the essentials

graceful steps down the path
keys unlocking the new car
click goes the buckle
vroom goes the engine

door bell rings through the night
the door flies open fast
special someone steps up
and a kiss is planted to your lips<|endoftext|>

It's early morning the day before Thanksgiving
There came about 8 more inches of snow
overnight There's almost an expectant hush as if
something more than dawn lies over the horizon
Although there's no moon it's luminous Starlight
shimmers off the heavy drifts painting broad
glowing brushstrokes over sleeping yards Each
bared branch and branchlet draped in layers white
satin evening wraps about to slip off shoulders to
the floor if the trees should shrug  all on the verge
of melting so that the wet black boughs knit
remaining darkness against the light to give some
shape to what we see Like you beneath your
blankets and limned in glow of monitors The
squirrels are dreaming in their nests No one stirs
yet The whole landscape is clean untracked and
the quiet is so heavy as to hush the echoes of
occasional cars in the wet streets a few blocks
over or the whispered conversations of oxygen
and IV drips  One can almost forget the year that
machines and lights are an ordinary part of
everyday life that industry has ever passed this
way that the various tubes going in and out of you
are not your branches dreaming of spring buds
and waiting to leaf or that we conspire
to continue  It's quite
beautiful And I'm thinking of you And when you
come home healing you can know this too<|endoftext|>

Last summer the body of a girl was retrieved
from the roots of a lake in Florida
Her long matted blonde hair kept getting gnarled
in the fingers of the fishermen that found her
One man swore that he saw a tiny fish between her lungs
breathing heavily beneath the weight of her ribs

When I saw the story on the news
I thought of you and how you would yelp when I
saw you naked how you hid your pale body beneath the sheets
How it was always a joy to catch a glimpse
of your collarbones porcelainwhite
as your sweater fluttered to the ground

The therapist says it’s a defense mechanism
a form of resistance to weakness
but now I wonder
if maybe you had something hidden
growing in your ribs too<|endoftext|>

Last night I dreamed of Lena once again

She rose from out the ooze both slim and sleek

With moonlight on her there she looked like teak

And it was ever thus up from that fen

She’d rise her flesh went clean and smooth and men

Would stare in disbelief as she was meek

Yet powerful a goddess of the Greek

She’d stand before me sighing slightly then

 

I’d touch her cheek and twirl her luscious hair

And trace her lovely lips’ expressive arc

Then squeeze the tiny lobe of her small ear

When suddenly a chill went in the air

As cloud heads put my Lena in the dark

Her sharp silhouette would then disappear<|endoftext|>

when I fell in love I pressed my heels against the sky
as if in a bread oven
sitting with my forehead on the warm ground
and the wind and the butterflies and the clouds like smoke
were hard to be spoken they stuck inside my chest

without even knowing
I invented God in a new season of the year
believing it was the same
through days with sun and moon both white
because of heavy blessing it rained with sweet incense
clocks lagged behind from their minute hands
gooseberries and  red currants popped between my nails
milk teeth grew in my virgin bosom
with the name sculpted by man lips

I slept another one’s dream in a stranger’s bed
he looked at me on Sundays through the train window
he saw through me
from our century of loneliness only dust flew over
like from an old Bible leaves<|endoftext|>

every shout a drop of blood
squirting from the twisted veins
the destiny’s road opens
to another quite unknown corner

every shout stifled by heartbeat
of silence holds a desire to cut
the uneaten loaf of heart

their ears are deaf
a head of stone
a body of wood
fingers of clay that
have forgotten how to clasp a flower
or rise a hand in protest

music that has become air
settles down at the navel of midnight
it’s an angel singing
under the leihao tree to sleeping hours
to closed windows and doors
only the leaves and grasses of
the earth responds

with daybreak the lips the nose
the hands the limbs the eyes
awakened
the air lost its music
the angel is only a love disowned
by both the lover and the beloved<|endoftext|>

I watch him

rolling the straw paper between his fingers

He glances up  through long dark lashes

his lips parted slightly

as he exhales  a current of smoke

It hovers around his head like a dusty halo

A shaft of sunlight stabs at the smoke

writhing toward the ceiling

He drops the straw paper in the ashtray

flicks his ash on top of it

and leans back in his chair

regarding me with a blank stare

 

And then he smiles

the smoke clears

and I 

smile back<|endoftext|>

Fall leaves sweep by
Caught in the cool gusts of wind
Dancing coyly around an old pair of denim jeans
Walking briskly towards the graveyard
A cigarette tossed upon the ground
Huddle around the warmth
of the last dying embers
Laughing at the irony
in holding hands shivering
Neck is sore from lack of weight on shoulders
A 5 o'clock shadow covering
where the traces of a smile still linger
Pleading forward tongue
Grasping Mexico at the hems of her dress
Pleading for the irony
to return
Swept back the phoenix
in bright orange hair
with pale limbs unrestrained
Unrestricted swim across campus
in thrift store vintage attire
Incite doctrine with the sound of sneakers
upon pavement<|endoftext|>

It was October my favorite month 

The leaves were just beginning

to brighten in bursts

of golds and rusty oranges

 

We drove windows down

up the side of the mountain

to the graffiti covered rock

at the overlook

where the hang gliders

jumped off into the fall air

 

I was flying high

wrapped in his blue hoodie 

his arms looping behind me

and pulling me closer

 

We kissed under an autumn sky

kisses tasting like coffee

the cold breeze tossing my hair

into his smiling face

 

I packed a bag

with homemade banana muffins

and Mexican hot cocoa

He ate and I laughed

my heart open and untamed

 

Stashed in my pocket

after a walk

under a copse of oak trees

was a tiny bead of hope like a nut

oval and smooth as an acorn<|endoftext|>

Not easy to state the change you made
If I'm alive now then I was dead
Though like a stone unbothered by it
Staying put according to habit
You didn't just tow me an inch no
Nor leave me to set my small bald eye
Skyward again without hope of course
Of apprehending blueness or stars

That wasn't it I slept say a snake
Masked among black rocks as a black rock
In the white hiatus of winter
Like my neighbors taking no pleasure
In the million perfectlychisled
Cheeks alighting each moment to melt
My cheeks of basalt They turned to tears
Angels weeping over dull natures
But didn't convince me Those tears froze
Each dead head had a visor of ice

And I slept on like a bent finger
The first thing I was was sheer air
And the locked drops rising in dew
Limpid as spirits Many stones lay
Dense and expressionless round about
I didn't know what to make of it
I shone micescaled and unfolded
To pour myself out like a fluid
Among bird feet and the stems of plants
I wasn't fooled I knew you at once

Tree and stone glittered without shadows
My fingerlength grew lucent as glass
I started to bud like a March twig
An arm and a leg and arm a leg
From stone to cloud so I ascended
Now I resemble a sort of god
Floating through the air in my soulshift
Pure as a pane of ice It's a gift<|endoftext|>

My love how I smile when I think of our journey

These many years together I have loved you hated you needed you and failed you Countless times I put you behind everyone else choosing work dating money and responsibilities above you Draining you avoiding you cutting you down and pushing you into a box that's far too small For so long I thought you were ugly thin goofy and strange I kept trying to change you into something I thought people would like  but all that did was make you rigid and resentful I was wrong

I'm sorry my sweet for not seeing your unique beauty under that awkward smile I'm sorry it took me so long to recognize the incredible glow that shines from within you when you're feeling appreciated and cared for You have been so strong through all we have experienced it's hard to believe we have fit so much into these years but somehow you managed to shine bright through every step Something I forget to do from time to time I cherish the moments of clarity when I can hear you and feel your inner peace A deep breath and we are united in a tranquil state where nothing matters but our love for each other and for this exciting and abundant life

I promise to listen more
I promise to accept you
I promise to speak to you with care and kindness
I promise to always put you and your health first
I promise to take more baths dance eat healthy and laugh

I promise never to choose a relationship that will cause you harm or lessen you in any way you deserve to shine my love

I will always love you more and more every day

To my love My self My Ashleigh
Happy Valentines Day xoxo<|endoftext|>

My darling I have much to say
Where o precious one shall I begin 
All that is in you is princely
O you who makes of my words through their meaning
Cocoons of silk
These are my songs and this is me
This short book contains us
Tomorrow when I return its pages
A lamp will lament
A bed will sing
Its letters from longing will turn green
Its commas be on the verge of flight
Do not say why did this youth
Speak of me to the winding road and the stream
The almond tree and the tulip
So that the world escorts me wherever I go 
Why did he sing these songs 
Now there is no star
That is not perfumed with my fragrance
Tomorrow people will see me in his verse
A mouth the taste of wine closecropped hair
Ignore what people say
You will be great only through my great love
What would the world have been if we had not been
If your eyes had not been what would the world have been<|endoftext|>

autumn blew the whistle
of departure
a tree had gazed at another tree
for the whole summer
but still could not tell the secret
in her heart

when the wind started
she decided to write him a letter
he read and smiled
replied to her in all the falling leaves
laden with love<|endoftext|>

It was midnight over the darkened sea
when I saw you standing alone among the tides
Blue eyes glowing mysteriously
an ocean of love inside

Blue eyes they called to me
like a swirl of sapphire art
staring deeply
into my dazzled heart

Standing there in the swaying currents
the ocean at your mighty command
you parted the water with your gleaming trident
and took my mortal hand

We danced under the moonlight
the ocean beneath our feet
Blue eyes reflecting the sunlight
the signal of your retreat

Around you the water began to tower
pulling you back to your leadership
Your eyes revealed the true power
of the ocean's mighty grip

Standing here along the ocean shore
I miss your eyes ever so longingly
Sitting in your throne your dutiful chore
I wonder if you still think about me<|endoftext|>

Warmed by her hand and shadowed by her hair
As close she leaned and poured her heart through thee
Whereof the articulate throbs accompany
The smooth black stream that makes thy whiteness fair—
Sweet fluttering sheet even of her breath aware—
Oh let thy silent song disclose to me
That soul wherewith her lips and eyes agree
Like married music in Love's answering air
Fain had I watched her when at some fond thought
Her bosom to the writing closelier press'd
And her breast's secrets peered into her breast
When through eyes raised an instant her soul sought
My soul and from the sudden confluence caught
The words that made her love the loveliest<|endoftext|>

Letter of love so strangely thrilling
With all your countless wonder yet
Though Time our heart's hot fires have mastered
Bringing a pang of pained regret
The while your blest receiver holds you
His banished passions still rebel
No longer reason sacrifices
His sentimentso then farewell
Destroyed be this lovetoken treasured
For if 'tis read when time has flown
Deep in the buried soul 'twill waken
The torment vanished days have known
At first but a light scorn arousing
For silly childishnessat last
With fiery yearning overwhelming
And jealousy for all the past

O Thou from whom a myriad letters
Speak with the breath of love to me
Though my gaze rest on thee austerely
Yet yetI cannot part with thee
Time has revealed with bitter clearness
How little thou with truth wert blessed
How like a child my own behaviour
Yet dear to me I still must save
This flower scentless without colour
From off my manhood's early grave<|endoftext|>

DEAR Anna hast ne'er heard it told
How florists have the curious power
To graft on some rude gardenplant
A tender and exquisite flower
Thus are our natures made as one
In union mystic and divine
Thus sweetest rose of womanhood
Thy life is blooming into mine

Forget thee Whence the childish fear
Ah vain would be such heartrecalling
Have I not felt thine angel smiles —
Thy tears upon my bosom falling
How oft when through our lattice stealing
The moonlight came in quivering gleams
When thou wert by my side reposing
Thy spirit busy with its dreams —

In love that would not let me sleep
I hung above thy tranquil rest
Whose soft low breathings scarcely stirred
The snowy folds upon thy breast
And watched to see thy starry eyes
Beam from their blueveined lids' eclipse
And drank thy very breath and kissed
The nightdew from thy rosebud lips

As one in moonlit starcrowned night
Marks not the dark and envious shades
That lurk within the gardenbower
Or glide along the forestglades
Thus heed I not life's shadows dim
Though gathering fast around above
The blessed while 't is mine to feel
The silvery presence of thy love<|endoftext|>

Darling little woman just a little line
 Just a little silver word
For that dear gold of thine
 Only a whisper you have so often heard

Only such a whisper as hidden in a shell
 Holds a little breath of all the mighty sea
But think what a little of all its depth and swell
 And think what a little is this little note of me

'Darling I love thee that is all I live for'—
 There is the whisper stealing from the shell
But here is the ocean O so deep and boundless
 And each little wave with its whisper as well<|endoftext|>

Phoebus make haste the day's too long begone
The silent night's the fittest time for moan
But stay this once unto my suit give ear
And tell my griefs in either Hemisphere
And if the whirling of thy wheels do n't drown'd
The woful accents of my doleful sound
If in thy swift career thou canst make stay
I crave this boon this errand by the way
Commend me to the man more lov'd than life
Show him the sorrows of his widow'd wife
My dumpish thoughts my groans my brackish tears
My sobs my longing hopes my doubting fears
And if he love how can he there abide
My interest's more than all the world beside
He that can tell the stars or Ocean sand
Or all the grass that in the meads do stand
The leaves in th' woods the hail or drops of rain
Or in a cornfield number every grain
Or every mote that in the sunshine hops
May court my sighs and number all my drops
Tell him the countless steps that thou dost trace
That once a day thy spouse thou mayst embrace
And when thou canst not treat by loving mouth
Thy rays afar salute her from the south
But for one month I see no day poor soul
Like those far situate under the pole
Which day by day long wait for thy arise
O how they joy when thou dost light the skies
O Phoebus hadst thou but thus long from thine
Restrain'd the beams of thy beloved shine
At thy return if so thou couldst or durst
Behold a Chaos blacker than the first
Tell him here's worse than a confused matter
His little world's a fathom under water
Naught but the fervor of his ardent beams
Hath power to dry the torrent of these streams
Tell him I would say more but cannot well
Opressed minds abrupted tales do tell
Now post with double speed mark what I say
By all our loves conjure him not to stay<|endoftext|>

Do you believe me
My Lisa
Words can give warm hugs

My love is
Unbroken

Even if
Love colour changes
Come as you are

Time for rest
Everlasting
Daydream


It is always sudden
I am sorry

When I am dead
The warmest rain
Tomorrow
For You<|endoftext|>

He worked until his hands bled

staining the marble dust on the floor

He worked in his shop in the alley

Just outside his chamber door

 

For his passion was his labor

And his labor was his life

If his time would just allow him

he would carve his angel wife

 

She was gone for thirty years now

but she never left his mind

She was gone but he was certain

In the marble her he'd find

 

As the final chips cascaded

like her hair fell on his skin

He had realized his dream

To hold her hand just once again<|endoftext|>

Whispers come from the two intruders on the beach

Laughter spiraling up into the dusky evening

Telling of secrets and jokes and the coming of an end

To conscience

 

Redorange fingers reach for her

The breeze darting into her ears

Telling her things she doesn’t wish to hear

Of chastity and waiting

But they are short lived

Her choices are made

Daringly flung into Fate’s ribbon

 

She listens to the crash of sea against rocks instead

Ebbing and flowing

Foam tossed into the air like a babe

The red of warning departs sunset replaced by

The deep stage of night

Stars tossed into the velvet sash of the evening

The props set the cove quiet

 

Just two of them and the shadows of doubt

Of half a mind to just sleep instead

The heady feeling of confidence disappearing

Under his gaze

 

His fingers skim the warmth of her hip

“You are beautiful”

It is murmured against the soft smoothness

Of her belly

Her level thoughts scatter in the pull

Of a dance as old as time itself

 

The barest hint of the moon’s rim

Watches down as bodies arc

And in a field of hazy almostdreams

Goodbyes are said to innocence<|endoftext|>

What kind of beast would turn its life into words
What atonement is this all about
and yet writing words like these I’m also living
Is all this close to the wolverines’ howled signals
that modulated cantata of the wild
or when away from you I try to create you in words
am I simply using you like a river or a war
And how have I used rivers how have I used wars
to escape writing of the worst thing of all—
not the crimes of others not even our own death
but the failure to want our freedom passionately enough
so that blighted elms sick rivers massacres would seem
mere emblems of that desecration of ourselves<|endoftext|>

Some people cannot endure
Looking down from the parapet atop the Empire State
Or the Statue of Libertythey go limp insecure
The vertiginous height hums to their numbered bones
     Some homily on Fate
Neither virtue past nor vow to be good atones

 

     To the queasy stomach the quick
Involuntary softening of the bowels
What goes up must come down it hums the ultimate sick
Joke of Fortuna The spine the world vibrates
     With terse ruthless avowals
From The Life of More A Mirror For Magistrates

 

     And there are heights of spirit
And one of these is love From way up here
I observe the puny view without much merit
Of all my days High on the house are nailed
     Banners of pride and fear
And that small wood to the west the girls I have failed

 

     It is on the whole rather glum
The cyclone fence the tarstained railroad ties
With now and again surprising the viewer some
Garden of selflessness or effort And as I must
     I acknowledge on this high rise
The ancient metaphysical distrust

 

     But candor is not enough
Nor is it enough to say that I don't deserve
Your gentle dazzling love or to be in love
That goddess is remorseless watching us rise
     In all our ignorant nerve
And when we have reached the top putting us wise

 

     My dear in spite of this
And the moralized landscape down there below
Neither of which might seem the ground for bliss
Know that I love you know that you are most dear
     To one who seeks to know
How for your sake to confront his pride and fear<|endoftext|>
