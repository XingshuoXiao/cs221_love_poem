No state is enviable To the luck alone
Of some few favoured men I would put claim
I bleed but her who wounds I will not blame
Have I not felt her heart as ’t were my own
Beat thro’ me could I hurt her heaven and hell
But I could hurt her cruelly Can I let 
My Love’s old time piece to another set
Swear it can’t stop and must for ever swell
Sure that’s one way Love drifts into the mart
Where goat legged buyers throng I see not plain
My meaning is it must not be again
Great God the maddest gambler throws his heart
If any state be enviable on earth
’Tis yon born idiot’s who as days go by
Still rubs his hands before him like a fly
In a queer sort of meditative mirth <|endoftext|>

All other joys of life he strove to warm
And magnify and catch them to his lip
But they had suffered shipwreck with the ship
And gazed upon him sallow from the storm
Or if Delusion came ’t was but to show
The coming minute mock the one that went
Cold as a mountain in its star pitched tent
Stood high Philosophy less friend than foe
Whom self caged Passion from its prison bars
Is always watching with a wondering hate
Not till the fire is dying in the grate
Look we for any kinship with the stars
Oh wisdom never comes when it is gold
And the great price we pay for it full worth
We have it only when we are half earth
Little avails that coinage to the old <|endoftext|>

It chanced his lips did meet her forehead cool
She had no blush but slanted down her eye
Shamed nature then confesses love can die
And most she punishes the tender fool
Who will believe what honours her the most
Dead is it dead She has a pulse and flow
Of tears the price of blood drops as I know
For whom the midnight sobs around Love’s ghost
Since then I heard her and so will sob on
The love is here it has but changed its aim
O bitter barren woman what’s the name
The name the name the new name thou hast won
Behold me striking the world’s coward stroke
That will I not do though the sting is dire
—Beneath the surface this while by the fire
They sat she laughing at a quiet joke <|endoftext|>

A diamond of a morning
Waked me an hour too soon
Dawn had taken in the stars
And left the faint white moon
 
O white moon you are lonely
It is the same with me
But we have the world to roam over
Only the lonely are free <|endoftext|>

Weak motion of grasses and tern before the sea
Worry’s school cresting here and everywhere
as failings
 
I pace the cliff path my hands cupped above my eyes
The glare steals your progress a kayak needling
the wide open
 
Love means you answer this the child’s rebuke
A pattern crosses the point hemming
the horizon steamship
 
I didn’t know you were the green pitch
unable to beat the storm to shore
You didn’t know I was the lookout
 
Get accustomed to the sad girl picking you
out of the sea the knot caught in her throat
and the unraveling of her speech an endless rope
thrown out of me <|endoftext|>

I have always hated the rain
And the gloom of grayed skies
But now I think I must always cherish
Rain hung leaf and the misty river
And the friendly screen of dripping green
Where eager kisses were shyly given
And your pipe smoke made clouds in our damp close heaven
 
The curious laggard passed us by
His wet shoes soughed on the shining walk
And that afternoon was filled with a blurred glory
That afternoon when we first talked as lovers <|endoftext|>

Walk into the world
Go into the places of trade
Go into the smiling country
But go clad wrapped closely always
Shielded and sustained
In the visible flame of my love
 
Let it blaze about you
A glowing armor for all to see
Flashing around your head
A tender and valiant halo
 
I think there will be many to wonder
And many to stand in awe and envy
But surely no one will come too close to you
No one will dare to claim you
Hand or heart
As you pass in your shining and terrible garment <|endoftext|>

If my love for you were a teacup
I would praise it for its blue I’d consider
Its delicate handle the pictures painted there
Of ladies of their parasols
But my love is not a teacup
 
It is not even the tar pit from which we draw
Fodder for the desolate streets oh lightless at night
Oh pathways asking for feet and their memory
It is not even a tugboat going
Bravely into morning carrying cordage and salt
 
Nor that saddest sickest animal
In the zoo carious mangy whose hair molts
Who with its wounds sits in the bare
Hay padded corner of a cell and licks
At the question of what it means to be here
 
Yet in winter my love is covered with the brightness
Of snow in winter my love is filled with eyes
It waits for me at the block’s edge
Habitual dog who walks me back into that gaseous
Entity we call life Others’ loves may wink and smile
 
Like the moon through a resurrection of vapors
Like the coy and barbarous moon who knows no allegiance
But my love is more like an ice sculpture
In a country of perpetual coldness which the heat
Of your anger cannot damage nor the pick
 
Of your words impugn Now
Lay your worry aside from you stranger
Put your hands near these curves do you feel
That hallowed temperature Among my people
We call this absolute love <|endoftext|>

In my dreams I’m always hovering
before the evening primroses

their centers of ruby gold and bent
stalks whispering praise to me

It’s always prelude playing here
bee edicts echoing down days

stung to silence under gauzy clouds
slivered moons and in steam

rising from pollen My portly
body taxis in repose I fall

in love Each night I deeper fall
my buzzing swarm swaddled

alike in dreams We are fuzzy
monks deep in contemplation

on mountains of mere wind
Our feet frizzle in prayer Nectar

rolls in our mouths like honey
withheld I am orotund rapture

that is me to thee dancing on nothing
substantial swaying in my stripes on thick air <|endoftext|>

Four lanes over a plump helium heart—

slipped maybe from some kid’s wrist
or a rushed lover’s empty passenger seat

through a half cracked car window—

rises like a shiny purple cloudlet
toward today’s gray mess of clouds

trailing its gold ribbon like lightning

that will never strike anything
or anyone here on the forsaken ground

its bold LOVE increasingly illegible

as it ascends over the frozen oaks
riding swift currents toward the horizon

a swollen word wobbling out of sight <|endoftext|>

It flares up at sunrise a blush in a bramble
Tumbling out of its bed by the city pavement—a single
Rose coral heat at the end of the season			
And you are drawn to it to its scent its silky
Layers to its core It gathers you into its 
Body until you lose your balance all you can see	
Is a petaled grid an endless repetition
Of roses You sink swirling into the rose
Deep into the rose into the rose
I hold you to me Love I am forty four 
And you love you my love
You have planted me <|endoftext|>

You are beautiful and faded
Like an old opera tune
Played upon a harpsichord
Or like the sun flooded silks
Of an eighteenth century boudoir In your eyes
Smoulder the fallen roses of outlived minutes
And the perfume of your soul
Is vague and suffusing
With the pungence of sealed spice jars
Your half tones delight me
And I grow mad with gazing
At your blent colors

My vigor is a new minted penny
Which I cast at your feet
Gather it up from the dust
That its sparkle may amuse you <|endoftext|>

On the day they killed the last caribou
I was in love—and I did not know
caribou or cities or the needs of either

I did not know scilla and did not know a new love
would be hired to trim the grass around it The blue flowers
came up through the grass like the grass remembering

This new love and I we drove once between cities of snow
and through the trees I could see a herd moving
matching us pulling away <|endoftext|>

The city is peopled
with spirits not ghosts O my love

Though they crowded between
and usurped the kiss of my mouth
their breath was your gift
their beauty your life <|endoftext|>

Love is a breach in the walls a broken gate
Where that comes in that shall not go again
Love sells the proud heart’s citadel to Fate
They have known shame who love unloved Even then
When two mouths thirsty each for each find slaking
And agony’s forgot and hushed the crying
Of credulous hearts in heaven—such are but taking
Their own poor dreams within their arms and lying
Each in his lonely night each with a ghost
Some share that night But they know love grows colder
Grows false and dull that was sweet lies at most
Astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder
But darkens and dies out from kiss to kiss
All this is love and all love is but this <|endoftext|>

I cut myself upon the thought of you
And yet I come back to it again and again
A kind of fury makes me want to draw you out
From the dimness of the present
And set you sharply above me in a wheel of roses
Then going obviously to inhale their fragrance
I touch the blade of you and cling upon it
And only when the blood runs out across my fingers
Am I at all satisfied <|endoftext|>

My mother wouldn’t stand up
to wave My father made certain
the door locked behind me

But when I went for your door
you came too Your mouth
made a flute of my arm

its music a glass on the past
My love my love went its song
Now there is no need to leave <|endoftext|>

We might have coupled
In the bed ridden monopoly of a moment
Or broken flesh with one another
At the profane communion table
Where wine is spilled on promiscuous lips

We might have given birth to a butterfly
With the daily news
Printed in blood on its wings <|endoftext|>

I would have each couple turn
join and unjoin be lost
in the greater turning
of other couples woven
in the circle of a dance
the song of long time flowing

over them so they may return
turn again in to themselves
out of desire greater than their own
belonging to all to each
to the dance and to the song
that moves them through the night

What is fidelity To what
does it hold The point
of departure or the turning road
that is departure and absence
and the way home What we are
and what we were once

are far estranged For those
who would not change time
is infidelity But we are married
until death and are betrothed
to change By silence so
I learn my song I earn

my sunny fields by absence once
and to come And I love you
as I love the dance that brings you
out of the multitude
in which you come and go
Love changes and in change is true <|endoftext|>

And what is love It is a doll dress’d up
For idleness to cosset nurse and dandle
A thing of soft misnomers so divine
That silly youth doth think to make itself
Divine by loving and so goes on
Yawning and doting a whole summer long
Till Miss’s comb is made a pearl tiara
And common Wellingtons turn Romeo boots
Then Cleopatra lives at number seven
And Antony resides in Brunswick Square
Fools if some passions high have warm’d the world
If Queens and Soldiers have play’d deep for hearts
It is no reason why such agonies
Should be more common than the growth of weeds
Fools make me whole again that weighty pearl
The Queen of Egypt melted and I’ll say
That ye may love in spite of beaver hats <|endoftext|>

Epithalamion Not too long back
I was being ironic about “wives”
It’s very well to say creation thrives
on contradiction but that’s a fast track
shifted precipitately into Tacky
some might say and look mildly appalled On
the whole it’s one I’m likely to be called on
Explain yourself or face the music Hack
No law books frame terms of this covenant
It’s choice that’s asymptotic to a goal
which means that we must choose and choose and choose
momently daily This moment my whole
trajectory’s toward you and it’s not losing
momentum Call it anything we want <|endoftext|>

I hid my love when young till I
Couldn’t bear the buzzing of a fly
I hid my love to my despite
Till I could not bear to look at light
I dare not gaze upon her face
But left her memory in each place
Where’er I saw a wild flower lie
I kissed and bade my love good bye

I met her in the greenest dells
Where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells
The lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye
The bee kissed and went singing by
A sunbeam found a passage there
A gold chain round her neck so fair
As secret as the wild bee’s song
She lay there all the summer long

I hid my love in field and town
Till e’en the breeze would knock me down
The bees seemed singing ballads o’er
The fly’s bass turned a lion’s roar
And even silence found a tongue
To haunt me all the summer long
The riddle nature could not prove
Was nothing else but secret love <|endoftext|>

Light so low upon earth 
You send a flash to the sun 
Here is the golden close of love 
All my wooing is done 
O all the woods and the meadows 
Woods where we hid from the wet 
Stiles where we stay'd to be kind 
Meadows in which we met 
Light so low in the vale 
You flash and lighten afar
For this is the golden morning of love 
And you are his morning star 
Flash I am coming I come 
By meadow and stile and wood
Oh lighten into my eyes and my heart 
Into my heart and my blood 
Heart are you great enough 
For a love that never tires 
O heart are you great enough for love 
I have heard of thorns and briers 
Over the thorns and briers 
Over the meadows and stiles 
Over the world to the end of it 
Flash of a million miles <|endoftext|>

Love comes quietly
finally drops
about me on me
in the old ways

What did I know
thinking myself
able to go
alone all the way <|endoftext|>

Which cannot be written tries anyway
From one room to another each time startled
And does not want to hear of the already

Passed through the country of before
Poem that at each door believes itself
In the room closest to the end

Where finally everything will be gone over
Dismantled held up carefully laid back down
While talked into the beauty which can turn

In a minute To hear of every other
Poem written is to begin
Revision and what cannot be left enough

Alone and so the lovers look at each other
Until none else can come near Poem
Which never wanted anything but this

Tries anyway so brave unable to know where
She heads unwrapping until only a gift
Which cannot be given as it cannot be let go <|endoftext|>
